# Morphology - Nouns

This section will present the morphology of nouns in the language, including personal pronouns.

## Inflection

Nouns belong to one of 4 classes and inflect for number and case.  These inflections take the form of suffixes.

### Classes and Number

Noun classes are inherited from Vuhîñkam, with Inanminate (I/INAN), Animate (A/ANIM) and Divine (D/DIVN).  The Animate class is separated into two, creating a new Human class (H/HUMN).

The distinctions between number varies between class.  Inanimate and Divine do not distinguish number at all, Animate distinguishes Singular (s/sn) and Plural (p/pl), while Human has a 3-way distinction between Singular, Dual (d/dl) and Plural.

The distinction between classes is mostly morphological.  A word can be 'converted' ad hoc to another class by tacking on the appropriate ending, with the effect of objectifying, animating, anthropomorphising or deifying the referent.

Endings for each class are:

- **Inanmiate** - no ending.  Nominative ends in -te or -to, but the dictionary form given is the Accusative for these nouns.
- **Animate** - vowel + -njh /ɲ̊/
- **Human** - vowel + voiced nasal
- **Divine** - -ke /kɛ/, -ge /gɛ/, -ko /kɔ/, -go /gɔ/

### Cases

Nouns (in general) inflect for 5 cases.  For more detail on the use of cases, see "4.2 - Syntax - Noun Phrases".

- **NOM** - Nominative case - used for the subject or agent of a verb; also used for both sides of a copula sentence and for disjoint/topical/vocative use.
- **ACC** - Accusative case - used for the object or direct patient of a verb.
- **DAT** - Dative case - used for attribute, motion, direction or action *towards* the noun.  Commonly used for objects of verbs where the object itself is not changed, e.g. 'he sees the tree'.
- **GEN** - Genitive case - used for attribute, motion, direction or action *of/from/due to* the noun.
- **LOC** - Locative case - used for attribute, motion, position or action *at/in/during/with/by/using* the noun.  

The Vuhîñkam Instrumentative case and Locative case have merged into one (except in postpositions).

While cases are often used by themselves, they can also be accompanied by a **postposition** to form a postpositional phrase.  These are detailed in doc 4.2.

## Inflection Paradigms

Inflections often have 2 forms for Front and Back vowels.  The two main strategies for choosing forms are either via the final vowel or the final *stressed* vowel - this varies by dialect.  The examples given in this doc vary by final vowel.

### Adding Class Inflection

Class inflections can be 'added' to words in certain situations, such as in regular/ad hoc formation of new words or when deriving forms for demonstrative and indefinite pronouns.  When converting from an existing class, the ending is usually stripped, but ad hoc derivations often keep them.  In either case, class endings are added in a specific way, dependent on the current ending:

- **Inanmiate** - Nominative end in -te or -to, Accusative adds no endings
- **Animate**
  - vowel final words > -njh /ɲ̊/
  - consonant final words > -enjh /ɛɲ̊/ or -onjh /ɔɲ̊/
- **Human**
  - vowel final words > -nj /ɲ/
  - consonant final words > -onj /ɔɲ/
- **Divine**
  - vowel or voiced consonant final words > -ge /gɛ/ or -go /gɔ/
  - unvoiced consonant final words > -ke /kɛ/ or -ko /kɔ/
    - glottal stop assimilates to K, producing -kke or -kko

### Inanimate

Example nouns: *püañh* 'meat stew' (front vowel) and *tuñgo* 'sorghum grain' (back vowel)

The Locative case ending derives from the old Instrumental case ending, instead of the Locative case ending for all other classes.

|case|ending              | example A | IPA         | example B | IPA        |
|----|------------        |-----------|-------------|-----------|------------|
|NOM | -te, -to           | püañte    | /ˈpyæɴ̥tɛ/   | tuñgoto   | /ˈtuɴgɔtɔ/ |
|ACC | no ending          | püañh     | /ˈpyæɴ̥/     | tuñgo     | /ˈtuɴgɔ/   |
|DAT |-(e)njêrh, -(o)nôrh | püañenjêrh| /ˈpyæɴ̥ɛɲer̥/ | tuñgonôrh | /ˈtuɴgɔnor̥/|
|GEN | -ix, -ëx           | püañix    | /ˈpyæɴ̥ix/   | tuñgoëx   | /ˈtuɴgɔɤx/ |
|LOC | -êra, -ôra         | püañêra   | /ˈpyæɴ̥eræ/  | tuñgoôra  | /ˈtuɴgɔoræ/|

Words with a final glottal stop interact with the suffix to give slightly different inflections.  Example noun: *qâ* 'what'

|case |ending          | word     | IPA       |
|-----|----------------|----------| --------- |
| NOM | -tte, -tto     | qâtto    | /ˈqʌttɔ/  |

| DAT | -ncêrh, -ntôrh | qântôrh  | /ˈqʌɲ̊cer̥/ |
| GEN | -'ix, -'ëx     | qâ'ëx    | /ˈqʌʔɤx/  |
| LOC | -rra           | qârra    | /ˈqʌrræ/  |

### Animate

Example nouns: *ħeianjh* 'pig' (front vowel) and *ħâeljonjh* 'insect' (back vowel)

Singular:

### Human

Example nouns: *źñärhên* 'miner' (front vowel) and *uttum* 'netmaker/fisher' (back vowel)

Capital 'N' in the following table stands for whichever nasal exists in the original root

The Dative Singular case ending derives from an inversion of the usual suffix order from expected class-case -ân-êter/-ânter > *nyêrh to case-class -êter-ân/-êtrân > -(i)nenj

Singular:

### Divine

- Example nouns:  
  - *qamke* /ˈɢæm̥kɛ/ '(personal) ancestor'
  - *ghâudokko* /ˈɣɑʊ̯ˌdɔkkɔ/ 'deity'
  - *ghu'iegge* /ˈɣuʔˌie̯ggɛ/ 'medicinal honey'
  - *zuñgo* /ˈzuɴgɔ/ 'eulogy'

Divine class nouns ending vary by un/voiced and simple/geminate stop, back/front vowel, giving 8 possible endings.  To inflect, follow the attributes of the base noun.  The Locative case is the only case which changes depending on gemination.

|case |ending        | example A| IPA       | example B   | IPA         |
|-----|----------    |---------|------------|---------    |-----------  |

| LOC | -gaħ, -ñgaħ  | ghu'ieñgaħ | /ˈɣuʔˌie̯ɴgæħ/ | zuñgaħ| /ˈˈzuɴgæħ/  |

## Determiners

Determiners go before the noun; agreement varies with each class of determiner.

Personal (or interrogative) pronouns in the Genitive case are used as possessive determiners (my, your, whose, etc)

Determiners may be used to modify pronouns in the same way as nouns.  When used for 1st and 2nd person pronouns, they assume the Human class (even if the referent is not human).

### Demonstratives and Interrogatives

Demonstratives (including the interrogative/infinitive determiner) inflect to agree with the noun's Class and Number.

There are 3 levels of proximity for definite determiners (and in general throughout the language) - Proximal (This), Medial (That) and Distal (That over there), correponding to an area close to the speaker, close to the listener and far from both, respectively.  However these frames of reference are only approximate; the choice of proximity level is a purely semantic one.

Along with these proximity levels there is an additional Interrogative / Indefinite level (which / what / whichever), concerting things at an unknown or irrelevant location / distance.  These 4 levels are also in use for locative pronouns.

|Meaning|Inanimate  |Animate       |Human        |Divine           |

### Quantifiers and Numbers

Quantifiers agree only for the noun's Class, while Numbers are always invariant.  Marking number on the noun is optional when these determiners are used; generally only being used to emphasise the pluralness of the modified noun.  Thus *kfanjh ħeianjh* 'many pigs' is more commonly used compared to *kfanjh ħeiancex*.

Note that there is little distinction between mass and countable nouns, so there are no different words for countable vs uncountable nouns or grammatical restrictions on the use of these words with 'uncountable' nouns.

The 'Indefinite quantifier' can mean either 'some X' (as in 'some person') or 'any X'.  Deriving from *rhe* 'one', it shares a form when modifying inanimate nouns, thus *rhe tfaśśa* can mean either 'one tree' or 'any tree/some tree'.

|Meaning| English eg |Inanimate    |Animate         |Human           |Divine           |
|-------| ---------- |----------   |-------         |-----           |------           |
| No    | No pigs    |quś /ˈɢuɕ/   |qvanjh /ˈɢʋæɲ̊/  |qvâenj /ˈɢʋɑe̯ɲ/ |quśko /ˈɢuɕkɔ/   |
| Less  | Less pigs  |quto /ˈɢutɔ/ |qutonjh /ˈɢutɔɲ̊/|qutënj /ˈɢutɤɲ/ |qukke /ˈɢukkɛ/   |
| More  | More pigs  |vete /ˈʋɛtɛ/ |vetenjh /ˈʋɛtɛɲ̊/|vetênj /ˈʋɛteɲ/ |vekko /ˈʋɛkkɔ/   |
| Few   | Few pigs   |xê /ˈxe/     |xênjh /ˈxeɲ̊/    |xên /ˈxen/      |xêkke /ˈxekkɛ/   |

Numbers will be presented in section 5.5 Semantics - Numbers and Measurement.

### Examples

| Uħħuonanjh      | English                   |
|---------------- |--------------------       |
| xieñ püante     | some meat stew (I)        |
| xeñh ħâeljonjh  | some insects (A)          |
| qvâenj uttuñaħ  | with no fishers (H.LOC)   |
| qaikke qamkêrh  | to every ancestor (D.DAT) |
| ljêr qamke      | five ancestors (D)        |
| ljêr źñärhênjix | from five miners (H.GEN)  |

## Pronouns

Uħħuonanjh is pro-drop, meaning it tends to drop pronouns when allowed.  There are two areas where redundancy can cause a pronoun to be dropped, although in general any pronoun (or noun phrase) can be dropped if enough context is given:

- Locative pronouns (covered in the section 3.3 - Verbs in morphology) combined with context often provide enough information for subject pronouns to be dropped - along the lines of 'here (I) hold a pen'.  Note that locative pronouns are required for certain verb forms.
- Sentence-final tags often conjugate for both nominative and accusative arguments, meaning that Nominative and Accusative pronouns are able to be dropped

### Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns have 2 distinct forms for Nominative and Accusative, while other case forms are derived from the Accusative form.  In addition to case, these pronouns inflect for number and noun class for the 3rd person.

2nd and 3rd person pronouns have a Dual number, whose meaning has shifted to a singular referent of that person plus the speaker - thus 2nd person Dual is 'Thou and I' while 3rd person (Human) Dual is 'S/he/it and I'.

The pronouns for 3As (3rd person Animate singular) and 3Hs (3rd person Human singular) in DAT/DEN/LOC cases coincide, but are distinguished by an unvoiced nasal in the Animate vs a voiced nasal in the Human one.  However, these phonemes have begun to merge in many varieties, as a result they are often pronounced similarly if not identically.

|Person| NOM         | ACC           | DAT      | GEN     | LOC     |
|-----|------------- |---------------|--------  |-------- |-------- |

### Demonstrative and Interrogative Pronouns

Demonstrative determiners (as listed above) can be used without a modified noun as a *demonstrative pronoun* (similar to English 'That house is red' vs 'That is red').  Ambiguities (whether the demonstrative modifies a noun or acts as a pronoun when a noun follows it) are usually rectified by sentence-final tag conjugations, or by inserting a pause in speech.  Demonstrative pronouns inflect for case, taking regular case endings (including mutating the final nasal for Animate/Human).

The above interrogative pronoun can be used in the same way as the demonstrative pronouns (what / who / which one).  Some forms are given here with English equivalents.  Note that the interrogative pronoun should take the relevant class if a particular response is expected (e.g. Human class for people, Animate class for animals and other 'animate' words, etc); if unknown then use Inanimate.

| what (D)                                  | qâkke    | DIVN   | NOM |

There are also special interrogative pronouns that can be used instead for specific meanings.  These special pronouns are considered to already be inflected in **Locative** case and **Inanmiate** class, thus they can't take extra inflections and modifiers (adjectives and determiners) must agree with these.

| where | qe  |
| when  | qo  |
| how   | qei |

### Indefinite Pronouns

Similar to demonstrative/interrogative pronouns above, quantifiers can also be used as *indefinite pronouns*.  Using the appropriate class form, they also inflect for case and number.  Numbers can also be used, taking on class endings.  Some examples are given below.

|Meaning            |Word         |Class |Case |
|-------------------|-------------|------|-----|
| everything        | qeaħte      | INAN | NOM |
| everything        | qeaħ        | INAN | ACC |
| to everything     | qeaħenjêrh  | INAN | DAT |
| from everything   | qeaħix      | INAN | GEN |
| (at) everywhere   | qeaħêra     | INAN | LOC |
| everything (A)    | qeanjh      | ANIM | NOM |
| everyone          | qaonj       | HUMN | NOM |
| everyone          | qaoñgeu     | HUMN | ACC |
| to everyone       | qaonenj     | HUMN | DAT |
| from everyone     | qaonjix     | HUMN | GEN |
| with everyone     | qaoñaħ      | HUMN | LOC |
| everything (D)    | qaikke      | DIVN | NOM |
| five (things)     | ljêrte      | INAN | NOM |
| five (things)     | ljêr        | INAN | ACC |
| five (things) (A) | ljêrenjh    | ANIM | NOM |
| five (people)     | ljêrenj     | HUMN | NOM |
| to five (people)  | ljêrenenj   | HUMN | DAT |
| five (things) (D) | ljêrge      | DIVN | NOM |

The corresponding meaning of each quantifier is as follows:

| Quantifier   | Meaning                    | INAN-ACC  |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | --------- |
| No           | Nothing, No-one            | quś       |
| Less         | Less things, Less people   | quto      |
| More         | More things, More people   | vete      |
| Few          | A few (things/people)      | xê        |
| Some         | Some (things/people)       | xieñ      |
| Many         | Many (things/people)       | ku'       |
| Every        | Everything, Everyone       | qeaħ      |
| Indefinite   | Some/Anything, Some/Anyone | rhe       |
