# Morphology - Adverbs

This section will detail the morphology of adverbs in the language.

Adverbs, along with verbs, shed much of their inflection which was instead attached to the sentence-final Tag particle.  They retain only the Imperfective vs Perfective, but unlike verbs this is a regular inflection with very few irregular forms.

## Adverb Usage and Agreement

Adverbs can be used to modify either verbs, other adjectives / adverbs or apply to entire clauses / sentences.  When modifying a verb or a phrase with a verb (not including participles) they agree with the verb's aspect.  When modifying a verb or an adjective / adverb, they appear *before* the modified word, whereas when modifying a clause or sentence they can appear anywhere within it, but by default will appear before the final 'head' - usually the sentence-final Tag or the participle head of a relative clause.  

The imperfective and perfective suffixes *can* also be used when the adverb is modifying participles or clauses headed by participles, and it is common to use a dummy adverb (commonly *ħeffa* 'well') to mark this when a participle represents a verb with quite different imperfective and perfective meanings, if the meaning is not evident from context or needs particular emphasis.

While the use of a specific intensifier adverb such as *meccafa heffa/ñêra* 'very well/round' does happen when modifying adjectives and adverbs, it is also common to simply duplicate the adverb (if modifying an adverb) or duplicate the adjective and turn it into an adverb - *heffa heffa* 'very well', lit. 'well well' and *ñêrafa ñêra* 'very round', lit. 'roundly round'.

### Agreement and Inflection

Example words are: *ħeffa* 'well', *xam* 'up(wards)', *uirâ - uir - uirñe* 'to go (PART - PERF - IMPF)'

|Form   |Affix   |Example A     |IPA         |Example B    |IPA          |
|----   |--------|--------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
|neutral| -      | ħeffa uirâ   |/ˈħɛffæ/    | xam uirâ    |/ˈxæm/       |
|PERF   | -(a/â)f| ħeffaf uir   |/ˈħɛffæf/   | xamaf uir   |/ˈxæmæf/     |
|IMPF   | -(a/â)ñ| ħeffañ uirñe |/ˈħɛffæɴ/   | xamañ uirñe |/ˈxæmæɴ/     |

## Derivation

An unstressed version of the inherited suffix is still productive in Uħħuonanjh, this suffix is used to derive adverbs from adjectives - including participles acting as adjectives, which is commonly used to express 'while doing X'.  Many common adverbs are ultimately derived from the stressed version of this suffix, but this stressed version is no longer productive.
