# Short Examples

Short glossed and briefly explained examples to demonstrate use of the language

## Cases as Verb Arguments

- Nominative case
  - There is a/the tree here.
  - Xeañ mu tfaśśate qâ.
- Accusative case
  - I scratched a/the tree.
  - Vanca mu tfaśśa qârhmo.
- Dative case
  - I saw a/the tree here.
  - Jêñghanjh mu tfaśśanjêrh qârhmo.
- Genitive case
  - I'm talking here about a/the tree.
  - Vaħħaoe mu tfaśśaix qâmo.
- Locative case is not generally used as a verb argument

```
xeañ     mu  tfaśśa-te  qâ

```

Note that Dative and Accusative cases are both commonly used as the Object.  Accusative is generally used only for objects which have undergone change or been affected by the action; Dative is used otherwise.  Accusative can be used for verbs that usually expect a Dative to emphasise that the Object has been affected by the action, perhaps as an unintended consequence.  The opposite also works, though usually to express that the action was simply performed in the direction of the object and not on it directly.

- Accusative case
  - I saw a/the tree here (which caused it to change)
  - Jêñghanjh mu tfaśśa qârhmo.
- Dative case
  - I scratched at/in the direction of a/the tree here (but didn't touch the tree itself)
  - Vanca mu tfaśśanjêrh qârhmo.

## Topic and Definiteness

There are no definite or indefinite articles in the language, and in most usage a noun can express either, however certain aspects of the language tend to suggest in/definiteness.  Demonstratives can be used to enforce **definiteness** ('this flower', etc), otherwise topicalisation, use of tag conjugation and certain inflections (when compared against similar-meaning words formed with derivation affixes) tend to suggest definiteness.  Indefinite determiners can be similarly used to enforce **indefiniteness** ('any flower', etc).  Most words formed with derivation affixes tend to refer to indefinite nouns also ('floral' vs 'of (some specific) flower', etc).  Using the indefinite/infinitive Locative Pronoun in a sentence generally marks it as a gnomic/generic sentence (e.g. birds fly; sky is blue) with indefinite arguments, though using other Locative Pronouns doesn't necessarily rule out a generic meaning.

Any noun (inflected or not, including pronouns) or adverb can be topicalised.  There are 3 main methods of topicalisation; they are listed in order of ascending 'topicalisation' below.  Note that not all methods work in all cases - adverbs can only topicalised by shifting to first place, for example.

- Conjugate for the topic in the Tag as the first of any person suffixes.  Allowed only when the topic is an argument of the verb
- Shift it to the first element of the clause, maintaining the same case (and conjugate in Tag if possible)
- Both of the above, but use Nominative case in the noun (maintaining the same case in the Tag suffix)

- Ljanji mu ma' qâmotśarh. - ambiguous > I give you here a/the flower.
- Topicalisation examples
  - Ljanji mu ma' tśarêrh qâ**yêr**mo. - semi-topicalised 'flower' > The flower I give to you.
  - **Ma'** ljanji mu tśarêrh qâyêrmo. - topicalised 'flower' > The flower, I give it to you.
  - Mat**te** ljanji mu tśarêrh qâyêrmo. - vocative and topicalised 'flower' > The flower, it is what I give to you.
- In/definite examples
  - Ljanji mu **aoś** ma' qâmotśarh. - I give you here **this** flower.
  - Ljanji mu **rhe** ma' qâmotśarh. - I give you here **some/any (a)** flower.
- Notes
  - Maximum of 2 argument suffixes allowed on tag; when 'flower' as a topic is added, one must be removed (and used as a full pronoun)

Clause breakdown:

- *Jêñghanjh vâe ... fimtśancêrh qâmo*
  - 'seeing there ... to-dog I-do' > I see a dog there
  - Main clause, thus word order is (topic)-Verb-Locative-Nouns-Tag
  - Indicative mood
- *Teñkeu ghâuaśenjêrh qârhljë xaśanjh (fimtśancêrh)*
  - 'to-self on-roof made-do arriving' > (the dog, which) made itself arrive to a roof
  - Subordinate clause, thus word order is (topic)-Nouns-(locative)-Tag-Verb
  - Tag is normally optional, but used here for the Causative aspect
  - Anchored by participle *xaśanjh* 'arriving'
  - Relative clause used as an adjective to describe following noun *fimtśanjh* 'dog'
- *Kśanjo jêñ fimtśanjh ... ca'onôrh nji,*
  - 'can not-generally dog ... to-climibing if' > If dogs in general cannot climb
  - Main clause, thus word order is (topic)-Verb-Locative-Nouns-Tag
  - Clause coordinated with next one
  - Conditional mood; when coordinated this means 'if'
- *Ca'êr ca'o (-nôrh)*
  - 'ladder climbing' > 'climbing ladders'
    - note that this is different to an English noun phrase like 'ladder climbing' in that 'ladder' is in the Accusative Case here and used as a typical verb argument
  - Subordinate clause, thus word order is (topic)-Nouns-(locative)-(tag)-Verb
  - Small subordinate clause, meaning no boundary commas/pauses are necessary
  - Anchored by participle *ca'o* 'climbing'
  - Used as a noun phrase in the main clause
- *Qei xaśanjh vâe âencârhqenjh?*
  - 'how arrive there ?-did-it'
  - Main clause, thus word order is Topic-Verb-Locative-(nouns)-Tag
  - Question word *qei* 'how' promoted to topic
  - Clause coordinated with the previous; previous was a condition so this is the result
  - Interrogative mood required for question
