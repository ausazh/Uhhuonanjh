# Noun Phrases

This section will detail noun phrases.  In particular, it will take a look at the many uses of the different cases and go through postpositional constructions and their use in different types of dependent clauses.

While the use of noun phrases as verb arguments and adverbials is often distinct, there is not a lot of strict differentiation between them.  It is common to place verb arguments before adverbials, but it is not grammatically required and it is also common to place an adverbial first when it's the topic.  Only verb arguments are usually allowed to take Tag person suffixes, which allows some differentiation.

## Verb Argument Use of Cases

Verbs aren't marked for transitivity or valency; each verb has a number of common arguments and all, or none, of these may be used at once with the sentence still being grammatically correct.  When an argument is omitted, it is either assumed to refer to an indefinite argument or a specific one if mentioned in context (including the context of the locative pronoun as well as pragmatic context).

When multiple arguments are present of the same case, it is simply assumed that they all take part in the action in the same role, e.g. 'Mary John run' == 'Mary and John run'.  A conjunction would only be used to join these noun phrases for emphasis.  The exception here is with the copula, where two or more Nominative arguments are equated - the common workaround is to place one side as a Topic, then use a plural pronoun to refer to all of them in the copular sentence itself, as in 'Mary John, they are doctors'.

- *verxanjh* 'to rain' - usually takes 0 arguments
  - *verxanjh mu qâ* - Is raining here
    - Standard usage, equivalent to 'It is raining (here)'
  - *verxanjh mu qâmoyêr* - I rain it here
    - Unusual usage, perhaps using 'rain' metaphorically, e.g. in the sense 'spread widely'
- *xea* 'to exist' - usually takes 1 argument (NOM)
  - *xeañ quo qâ* - exists somewhere
    - Unusual usage without context, equivalent to 'something exists somewhere'
    - Not unusual usage with context, equivalent to '(X,) it exists somewhere'
  - *xeañ mu qâ* - exists here
    - Common usage for when the thing that exists is known/obvious or irrelevant
    - Also common usage without context, where the locative 'mu' suggests a first person subject
  - *xeañ mu qâmo* - I exist here
    - Standard usage
  - *xeañ mu mvo muqqaśte urumvate qâ(ghâ)* - Me, a peach and a pear exist here
    - Standard usage
  - *xeañ mu qâmoyêr* - I exist it here
    - Unusual usage.  Use of additional ACC argument implies that 'it' has been changed/affected by my existence here.
- *ljêra'* 'to pull' - usually takes 2 arguments (NOM and ACC)
  - *ljêra' quo qâ* - pulls somewhere
    - Unusual usage, equiv. to 'pulling is happening somwhere'
  - *ljêra' mu qâ* - pulls here; *ljêra' mu qâmo* - I pull here
    - These two are usually equivalent outside of context
    - Common usage where the object is known/obvious or irrelevant
  - *ljêra' mu qâmoyêr* - I pull it here
    - Standard usage
  - *ljêra' mu yerêrh qâmo* - I pull to it here
    - Not unusual usage where the object is not considered to have changed/been affected by the action
      - e.g. 'I pulled the rock but it didn't budge', 'the rock' would be DAT instead of ACC to mark that it hasn't changed state/been affected
- *vaħħoñ* 'to say/tell' - takes up to 3-4 arguments (NOM, ACC/GEN, DAT)
  - *vaħħoñ quo qâ* - Someone somewhere talks
  - *vaħħoñ mu qâ(mo)* - (I) talk here
  - *vaħħoñ mu qâmoyêr* - I say it here
  - *vaħħoñ mu yerix qâmo* - I talk about it here
  - *vaħħoñ mu tśarêrh qâmoyêr* - I tell you it here
  - *vaħħoñ mu tśarêrh yerix qâmo* - I talk to you about it here
  - *vaħħoñ mu yêr tśarêrh yerix qâmo* - I say it to you about him/her here

## Adverbial Use of Cases

Nouns inflected in DAT/GEN/LOC cases are commonly used as simple adverbials.

Nouns in NOM or ACC case can be placed before the verb as a disjoint Topic (one that doesn't play any explicit role in the sentence other than to set the context).  It is common to place inanimate topics in ACC and all other topics in NOM, though this can be inverted to place an emphasis on the agency of an inanimate noun or the non-agency of others.

Some examples of simple adverbials:

- DAT
  - to / towards
  - for / for X's sake
  - onto/into/out to/over to/etc X
  - in order to X
  - until X / up to X / before X
  - similar to X
- GEN
  - of X / X's
  - from X / away from X / off X
  - against X
  - from X onwards / starting from X / after X
  - about X / regarding X
  - because of X
  - around X
- LOC
  - at/in/on X, on top of X
  - with/by/using/through/via X
  - along with X / along X
