# Sentence Structure

This section will go through methods of constructing proper sentences in Uhhuonanjh.

## Type

Word order is VL-T, with all other adverbials, verb arguments and noun phrases coming between the verb and the tag.  Word order of these intervening elements is not strict as nouns are marked for case, though the first element tends to be the topic.  A minimal sentence consists of a Verb and a Tag, although while the Locative Pronoun is not required grammatically, it is almost always present, at least in the first sentence of a dialogue or communication.

## Topic Prominence

Uhhuonanjh is a Topic-Prominent language, tending to place the sentence Topic first among noun phrases, regardless of case.  Noun phrases can appear in any order as long as they are between the Verb/Locative pronoun and the Sentence-final Tag of a main clause, or before the verb (and after a comma) of a dependent clause.

Topic prominence is also expressed through the conjugation of sentence-final tags, where arguments are usually placed topic-first, with the topic suffix stressed.

|**The pear**, I brought it home for you|ienjaś mu urumva camħencêrh tśarêrh qârh**yêr**mo|
|**Home**, I brought the pear for you   |ienjaś mu camħencêrh urumva tśarêrh qârh**yêr**mo|
|**For you**, I brought the pear home   |ienjaś mu tśarêrh urumva camħencêrh qârh**tśarh**mo|

## Copular Constructions

The copula is expressed with the imperfective verb *qâeñ* (*qâe, jêño* participles).  When equating two noun phrases, both are used in the Nominative case.

The copula is not used as a separate verb for adjectives.  Instead, it is suffixed to the adjective (as *-qoñ*) to convert the adjective into a verb meaning 'to be X'.

## Conjunctions and Coordinate Structures

Conjunctions such as *ħuom* 'and' can link sentences, coming between them with slight pauses before and after (expressed in writing with a comma before and after).

Conjunctions include:

- *ħuom* 'and' - used both as a conjunction and to link noun phrases
- *vorhâr* 'or' - used both as a conjunction and to link all kinds of phrases (noun, verb or descriptor)
- *rhu* 'if' - generally restricted to formal use as its function has largely been replaced by the Conditional Mood
- *verh* 'because'
- *fezzo* 'so, then'

Sentences can also simply link to each other with no conjunction in between, with the relationship determined either by the mood of each sentence (especially Conditional mood) or by the logic between the two sentences.

e.g. 'I sit and you eat', while it could be rendered as 'I sit, *huom*, you eat', would more commonly simply be rendered as 'I sit, you eat'.  Same for 'he saw us so he knows', which could more commonly be 'he saw us, he knows' rather than explicitly using the conjunction *fezzo*.
