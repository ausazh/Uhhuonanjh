# Verb Morphology

This section will detail verb morphology, including locative pronouns which play a large part in that.

The following chapter, 3.3, gives details about sentence-final Tags, another crucial element to the verb's meaning.

## Verb Roots

As the language evolved, the verb system became increasingly complex and unwieldy as affixes were added to the verb from both sides, changing its structure, and after drastic sound changes some of these different verb forms became almost unrecognisable.  To simplify this, the language merged many of the different verb forms and shifted conjugations to other parts of the sentence, primarily Locative Pronouns and Sentence-Final Tags.

Uhhuonanjh now distinguishes 4 roots for the verb itself - **Participle (PART), Negative Participle (NEG.PART), Perfective (PERF) and Imperfective (IMPF)**.  These roots are sometimes quite different among themselves and often are considered separate words rather than different forms of a single word, especially as the mechanisms to derive them no longer exist.  For more information on the different meanings of some verb roots, see Section *5.3 - Syntax - Aspect*.

### Participles

The **Participle** and **Negative Participle** forms function as either inanimate nouns or adjectives, but can themselves be the head of a subordinate clause.  In these uses, the words inflect for case/agreement just like any other noun or adjective.

When used as a noun, Participles represent the action (e.g. 'singing' in 'singing is difficult'), while when used as an adjective, they signal that the noun is 'performing' the action (e.g. 'singing' in 'the singing man').  The Negative Participle is simply the negated form of the Participle (e.g. 'not singing is difficult', 'the not-singing man').  Unlike English, these can still take arguments as a verb (similar to 'the singing-a-song man').  Use of participles will be detailed further in 3.3 - Adjectives and 4.3 - Verb Phrases.

The Participle is derived from the Vuhîñkam verb without any modifications, while the Negative Participle of inherited verbs is derived from the negated form of that verb using the complex infix system - this system itself is no longer productive.  Some examples of inherited participles and their negative counterparts are given below

|English         |Participle |IPA             |Negative Part|IPA             |

The PART and NEG.PART forms of *yatfa* 'to laugh' have merged through sound changes; while in formal language this is maintained, in common speech the negative participle is constructed through the new regular prefix, becoming quyafta /ɢuˈɟætfæ/

For newly-derived or newly-coined verbs, the Negative Participle simply adds qu- (without moving stress).  Colloquially, this form of negation is also used for words with existing counterparts, breaking them up into two separate words, with the original negative often taking on a new meaning.  Some examples:

|English           |Participle |IPA             |Negative Part|IPA             |
|------------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|

### Verbal forms

The **Perfective** and **Imperfective** verb roots form the head of a sentence when paired with a final Tag, with the verb taking on the respective aspect.  These roots do not conjugate or take any affixes other than for new word derivation.

While these forms are less variable than the above participles, they still contain some unpredictable changes and the meanings between Perfective and Imperfective forms are beginning to diverge.

Each pair has a *Base Aspect* which determines its derivation -- Perfective Base verbs have a Perfective form identical to the Participle, while the Imperfective is derived with an additional final vowel or occasionally ñ + vowel.  Imperfective Base verbs derive their Imperfective form through either the addition of a suffix -ñ to the Participle, or more unpredictable mutations usually ending in -anjh, while the Perfective is derived from the Imperfective + suffix -of/-ef.  In all these cases, stress is changed to fit the new pattern (maintaining penultimate position).

|English         |Base|Perfective  |IPA             |English         |Imperfective |IPA            |

For newly derived or coined verbs, the Perfective is formed by the addition of suffix -f/-of/-ef to the Participle, while the Imperfective is formed by the addition of suffix -o/-e.  These suffixes do not trigger stress changes.

## Locative Pronouns

Locative pronouns are simply pronouns which express location at one of the 4 levels of distance (Proximal, Medial, Distal and Indefinite).  These became commonplace during the language's development.  Due to their association with verbs, they have come to take on an additional role of Negative/Emphatic verb marker.  They also appear directly after verbs.  In order to negate a Verbal Form, a Locative Pronoun is used in the Negative.  The emphatic form either places emphasis on the verb (or location), or reinforces the verb, something like 'it definitely/truly/well/actually/for sure happens'.

Locative pronouns are not required for use with Participles, although they can still be used (in which case they appear directly *before* the participle).

|Distance|Positive|IPA        |Negative|IPA        |Emphatic|IPA           |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| INF    |quo     |/ˈɢuo̯/     |jêñ     |/ˈjeɴ/     |huñə    |/ˈħuɴɤ/       |
| PRX    |mu      |/ˈmu/      |tsimpü  |/ˈt͡ʃim̥py/  |huomu   |/ˈħuo̯mu/      |
| MED    |vâe     |/ˈʋɑe̯/     |ârvo    |/ˈʌrʋɔ/    |hâuo    |/ˈħɑʊ̯ɔ/       |
| DST    |minj    |/ˈmiɲ/     |ienjinj |/ˈie̯ɲiɲ/   |huomënj |/ˈħuo̯mɤɲ/     |

Examples of verb + locative

- *arrheañef quo* 'to happen / happens somewhere / anywhere'
- *arrheañef tħimpy* 'doesn't happen here/near me'
- *arrheañef hâuo* 'happens there/near you' (emphatic)
- *arrheañ jêñ* 'to not exist / doesn't exist somewhere / anywhere'
- *iccaf minj* 'sows over there/somewhere else'
- *iccae ârvo* 'isn't sowing there/near you'

### Locative Semantics

(More detail to be provided in section 5.4 - Locatives)

While Locative pronouns be themselves simply refer to a location, their common use has attached other pragmatic meanings to them.

One common attached meaning is of topic pronoun, with Proximal referring to a 1st person topic, Medial to a 2nd person topic, Distal to a definite 3rd person topic and Infinitive to an indefinite topic.  This topic can then be dropped if the meaning is clear.

Note that these examples contain final tags to form proper sentences, see the next section for details

- *qompëñ mu qâ*
  - lit. 'eats here'
  - also commonly meaning 'I/we eat' or 'as for me/us, (I/we) eat'
- *qompëñ mu quʔ*
  - lit. 'you.s eat here'
  - also commonly meaning 'with me/us, you eat'
- *qompëñ quo qâ*
  - lit. 'eats somewhere'
  - also commonly meaning 'someone/anyone eats' or 'somewhere, eating happens'
