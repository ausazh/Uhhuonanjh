# 2: Phonology and Romanisation

This section will present the phonology and romanisation of the language.

Note that as a language without a formal writing system, there is no 'official orthography'.  The romanisation system is a mostly 1-1 correspondance with pronunciation with a number of simplifications.

## Phonological Inventory

[back to chapter top](#2-phonology-and-romanisation)

### Vowel Inventory

There are 12 monophthongs and 13 diphthongs in the language, although /uɪ̯/ is commonly considered a 'simple' vowel along with the monophthongs, making 13 simple vowels and 12 complex vowels.  

These are also split into 12 back vowels, 12 front vowels and 1 central vowel, with an equal distribution of simple and complex vowels; coming to 6 of each for simple back, complex back, simple front and complex front vowels, along with 1 central vowel.

|height| simple front | complex front | central | simple back | complex back |
|---------|-------|---------|---|--------|---------|
|close    |/i/ /y/|/ie̯/     |   |/uɪ̯/ /u/|/uo̯/     |
|close-mid|/e/ /ø/|/ei̯/ /øʊ̯/|   |/ɤ/ /o/ |/ɤɪ̯/ /ou̯/|
|open-mid |/ɛ/    |/eɐ̯/     |   |/ʌ/ /ɔ/ |/oɐ̯/     |
|open     |/æ/    |/æɪ̯/ /æo̯/|/ä/|        |/ɑʊ̯/ /ɑe̯/|

### Consonant Inventory

There are 37 consonant phonemes in the language, organised into 5 general places of articulation.

All consonants may be geminated, though it is only common for stops, fricatives and trills.

|type       |labial |alveolar |palatal  |velar  |uvular-laryngeal|
|-----------|-------|---------|---------|-------|-------|
|nasal      |/m̥/ /m/|/n̥/ /n/  |/ɲ̊/ /ɲ/  |       |/ɴ̥/ /ɴ/|
|stop       |/p/ /b/|/t/ /d/  |/c/ /ɟ/  |/k/ /g/|/ʔ/ /ɢ/|
|affricate  |       |/t͡ʃ/ /d͡ʒ/|/c͡ɕ/ /ɟ͡ʑ/|       |       |
|fricative  |/f/    |/s/ /z/  |/ɕ/ /ʑ/  |/x/ /ɣ/|/ħ/    |
|approximant|/ʋ/    |/ɹ/      |/j/      |       |       |
|lateral apx|       |/l/      |/ʎ/      |       |       |
|trill      |       |/r̥/ /r/  |         |       |       |

- Voiced and unvoiced nasals and trills are found in complimentary distribution in most clusters, but are distinguished between vowels and morpheme-finally.  Voiced and unvoiced nasals are beginning to merge.
- The two trills are a result of a merger between earlier alveolar and guttural trills.  The resulting phoneme is realised differently among different areas - /r/ can be realised variously as \[r ~ ɾ], \[ɽ], \[ʐ], \[ʀ], \[ʁ], etc.
- The exact pronunciation of the postalveolar affricates /t͡ʃ/ and /d͡ʒ/ varies.  In addition to being pronounced as written, they may also be alveolar \[t͡s] \[d͡z], retroflex \[t͡ʂ] \[d͡ʐ] (reflecting earlier pronunciation) or may merge with palatal.
- /f/ and /ʋ/ are labiodental and assimilate adjacent bilabials to labiodentals.  /ʋ/ can sometimes be vocalised to \[ʊ ~ ʏ], especially when sandwiched in the middle of clusters/word-finally, e.g. /ˈmɛʔɔdʋ/ > \[ˈmɛʔɔdʊ]; /ˈɢæo̯rdʋɲæ/ > \[ˈɢæo̯rdʏɲæ]
- Uvular nasals will assimilate to nearby velars, becoming \[ŋ̊] \[ŋ].
- Glottal stop /ʔ/ can assimilate to nearby consonants, though in careful speech this is avoided.
- Most dialects assimilate voicing of nasals and trills when not otherwise assimilated in clusters (usually across morpheme boundaries), e.g. /ɴɛɲ̊/ + /ɟeɲ/ > \[ɴɛɲɟeɲ]

## Romanisation

[back to chapter top](#2-phonology-and-romanisation)

### Vowels

In writing, vowel diphthongs are not distinguished from vowels in hiatus, though they are in pronunciation; for example 'ea', while usually signifying the diphthong /eɐ̯/, can sometimes refer instead to 2 separate vowels /e.æ/.

|phoneme|written|phoneme|written|phoneme|written|phoneme|written|
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| /i/   | i     | /y/   | ü     | /uɪ̯/  | ui    | /u/   | u     |
| /e/   | ê     | /ø/   | ö     | /ɤ/   | ë     | /o/   | ô     |
| /ɛ/   | e     | /æ/   | a     | /ʌ/   | â     | /ɔ/   | o     |
| /ie̯/  | ie    | /ei̯/  | ei    | /uo̯/  | uo    | /ou̯/  | ou    |
| /øʊ̯/  | eu    | /eɐ̯/  | ea    | /ɤɪ̯/  | oi    | /oɐ̯/  | oa    |
| /æɪ̯/  | ai    | /æo̯/  | ao    | /ɑʊ̯/  | âu    | /ɑe̯/  | âe    |
| /ä/   | ä     |       |       |       |       |       |       |

Capital letters - Â - Ä - Ê - Ë - Ô - Ö - Ü

### Consonants

Voiced and unvoiced nasals are not distinguished in writing unless word-final, in which case the unvoiced nasals have an extra following 'h'.

Palatal digraphs with J, /ɲ̊/, /ɲ/ and /ʎ/, are written without the J when preceding another palatal consonant.  Unvoiced trill /r̥/ is written simply as R preceding another marked unvoiced consonant, including itself (i.e. excluding nasals).

|phoneme |written|phoneme |written|phoneme |written|phoneme |written|
|--------|-------|--------|-------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
|/m̥/, /m/| m     |/n̥/, /n/| n     |/ɲ̊/, /ɲ/| nj    |/ɴ̥/, /ɴ/| ñ     |
| /p/    | p     | /b/    | b     | /f/    | f     | /ʋ/    | v     |
| /t/    | t     | /d/    | d     | /s/    | s     | /z/    | s     |

## Prosody

[back to chapter top](#2-phonology-and-romanisation)

**Stress** is noticeable but rarely phonemic; very few minimal pairs exist for stress.  Stress primarily exists as a marker of word separation.  Most words have up to 2 stressed syllables by default, although certain affixes carry their own stress.  Speech is primarily stress-timed.  Pitch changes are also noticeable in the language, but entirely tied to stress.  While vowel length is non-phonemic, vowels tend to be lengthened when stressed and in an open syllable.

The first stress of a word root is the Primary Stress, realised with a high pitch and high volume, or mid-high pitch when no secondary stress is present.  Every other stress is a Secondary Stress, this is realised with a low pitch and equally high volume, or mid-low when another secondary stress follows.  Syllables after the primary and before a secondary stress tend to carry mid-high pitch; all other unstressed syllables carry a mid to mid-low pitch.  Some affixes carry their own Primary Stress, though this is rare (mostly derivational affixes).  An example of stress and pitch (with non-phonemic length also marked):

- Quoźo'âenquëx quo'onjëx ħumqampondoxkou
  - 'to the family/ies of the couple from The Twin Rivers'
  - /ˈɢuo̯ʑɔˌʔɑe̯nɢuɤx ˈɢuo̯ʔɔɲɤx ˈħumˌɢæm̥pɔnˌdɔxkou̯/
  - \[ˈɢuo̯ː˥ʑɔ˦ˌʔɑe̯n˩ɢu˧ɤx˧ ˈɢuo̯ː˦ʔɔ˧ɲɤx˧ ˈħum˥ˌɢæm̥˨pɔn˧ˌdɔx˩kou̯˧]

Sentence final tags can sometimes contain long strings with no stress; instead stress is inserted wherever necessary, sometimes to emphasise certain points but often arbitrarily.  These 'informal stresses' are generally somewhat softer than secondary stress.

## Phonotactics

[back to chapter top](#2-phonology-and-romanisation)

The maximum syllable size is CCLVCL, with only the central V mandatory.  Most syllables are maximally CCVC, the extra CL occurs due to the split of Vuhinkam affricate TS into TF/DV, as well as a few edge cases.  The second C in the initial cluster is usually a nasal, V/H/F (from Vuhinkam W), L/LJ/Ś (from Vuhinkam L), or X/GH (from Vuhinkam J).

Certain phonemes do not occur at the beginning or end of words:

- words cannot start with:
  - voiced stops and affricates EXCEPT Y /ɟ/ and Q /ɢ/
  - glottal stop
  - unvoiced nasals or rhotic
- words cannot end with:
  - voiced or unvoiced stops and affricates EXCEPT ' /ʔ/, K /k/, TF /tf/ or DV /dʋ/.
  - alveolars EXCEPT R/RH (L /l/, S /s/, Z /z/, Ŕ /ɹ/) - these get turned into palatals instead

Primary stress *usually* occurs on the first syllable of a word (barring prefixes), although this is not always the case, especially with *vowel + geminated trill* word initials.  Similarly, secondary stress *usually* occurs on the penultimate syllable of words with more than 3 syllables, but again this is not always the case due to merged or inserted syllables.

Front stressed syllables tend to lead to fronting of back vowels while Back stressed syllables tend to lead to backing of front vowels, though many historical vowels resisted these changes and vowel harmony is not particularly strict.  Certain suffixes have both front and back variants - depending on the dialect, these will change either depending on the final vowel or on the last stressed vowel.  If required to agree with central vowel Ä /ä/, these affixes may change arbitrarily and either form would be considered correct.  In general, the forms given in this doc and examples will agree with the final vowel (whether stressed or unstressed).

## Alternations

[back to chapter top](#2-phonology-and-romanisation)

Over the course of phonological evolution, some words picked up an unstressed prefix before an initial trill (note that some initial trills were generated *after* this process and thus don't have one).  This prefix is removed when a prefix is added to the word.  Example: *yiñ + (ar)rhanjh* 'pre- + standing' >> *yiñrhanjh*
