# Culture

This section will detail the culture of the Uhhuononj people through their development in the Bronze and Iron Ages.

## Agriculture and Cuisine

Crop farming had already been developed during the later Vuhinkam (Neolithic) era, especially around the river valley.  Techniques were further developed and new crops were domesticated during the Uhhuononj (Bronze/Iron) era, with agriculture spreading throughout Uhhuononj lands.  Animal domestication happened throughout the Vuhinkam era, and by the Uhhuononj era certain livestock had become commonplace.

### Crops - Icca

Crop names are given as Product name, Plant name - e.g. *icce* refers to the barley grains, *i'ma'* refers to the barley plant.  The uses of these crops will be given later in the Cuisine section.

### Metalworking

- Metals - *źñärhä*
  - **Gold** - *rheśrhä*
    - one of the first used metals, easy to use but rare.  Found in nuggets on the Sea Dragon Coast and surrounding lands.
    - usually simply Hammered *vônjof* into the desired shape by a Metalworker *źñârhôm*
  - **Tin** - *totfrhä*
    - used in the mid-late Vuhinkam era, difficult to process.
    - The development of the Bellows *uovdvë* allowed Smelting *rheük* to begin
  - **Copper** - *to'rhä*
    - used in the late Vuhinkam era (Chalcolithic), but difficult to process.
    - The development of the Furnace *rhekkê* allowed easier smelting and copper was commonly used in tools and weapons
    - Copper was rare however, mostly found in the north, encouraging settlement along the north coast
  - **Bronze** - *qundoarä*
    - the discovery and use of Bronze marks the beginning of the Bronze age, occurring around the same time as the Shech. migrations
    - the smelting industry was concentrated in the lower river valley
    - tools and weapons made with bronze allowed the towns of the lower river to flourish and dominate
    - Casting *erraonja'* using Casts *orrâeë* was developed as a way to mass produce bronze items
  - **Iron** - *ˈmiɕr̥a*
    - (meteoric) iron was used in the Copper/Bronze eras, valued for its toughness but incredibly rare and difficult to work with.  It was called *vaśrhä*, considered a gift from the sky
    - as smelting technologies improved, eventually Iron could be smelted successfully.  Iron was rare in the lower river valley, but common in the upper river valley (as well as the northlands and south coast).  Ironworking was first developed in upper river valley kingdoms after the Great Floods, and was what propelled the Central Kingdom to dominance.

## Knowledge and Mythology

The Pantheon of Gods was based on stories passed down through elders and solidified into a common set of deities which were respected, though not necessarily worshipped, by the end of the Vuhinkam era.  After the Migration, those that were left explained their ties to the land as worship of their ancestors, in the belief it would grant them powers and a better life.  These two concepts form the core of the Uhhuononj Mythology.

### Pantheon of Gods - *Ghâudokko*

The Pantheon of Gods was not codified until the start of the Lower River Kingdoms, where each kingdom had their own version of the pantheon; these were united into one official Pantheon in the Central Kingdom.  However, none of these entities worshipped the deities directly - there was no expectation that the deities themselves would pay any attention to mere humans.  This was resolved in two ways.

The first, which spread from the lower kingdoms and eventually dominated most of the Uhhuononj lands, held that each person's Ancestors were responsible for either liaising with the gods, or were granted powers over these gods' domains.  Thus, rather than worshipping the gods, it was more useful to worship one's ancestors, in order for them to intercede on behalf of the person and grant divine favour (or protect them from divine wrath).

The second, which was developed in the upper hills and spread throughout the highlands, maintained that through communual dedication to one deity in particular, the gods could be reached.  Thus, many highlands communities nominate a Patron Deity and worship them.  While the Cult of Ancestors still exists, it plays somewhat less of a role, especially in the mountains.

The Pantheon listed below is the form codified in the Central Kingdom (thus other variations can exist in other regions).  It is organised into 4 Pairs and 1 Triad.

- **Vaśnjoqquoggo** - The Pair of the Sky
  - **Ienjaoge** - God of the Night / Winter
  - **Yinddźaoge** - Goddess of the Day / Non-winter seasons
- **Tośquoggo** - The Pair of the Change
  - **Tfencikke** - Goddess of the Winds/Weather
  - **Qu'ħusko** - God of the Seasons/Harvests
- **Camħeqquoggo** - The Pair of the Constancy
  - **Xaqqêkke** - God of the Earth/Mountains
  - **Me'rheazge** - God of the Seas
- **Uħħuquoggo** - The Pair of Humanity/Human Worlds
  - **Vaoñdvikke** - Goddess of Travels/Knowledge/The Living World
  - **Ljaearmikke** - Goddess of the Dead/Ancestors/The Spirit World
- **Esakkxikke** - The Triad of Cycles
  - **Ljiħħeimge** - Goddess of Creation/Birth
  - **Qunljarge** - God of Destruction/War
  - **Jêñghakke** - The Watcher/The Balancer/The Judge/The Eye

### Cult of Ancestors

Most communities of Uhhuononj were part of a Cult of Ancestors.  However, the exact naure of the belief could be quite different.

For most early bronze age communities, it was common to worship a local pantheon of community ancestors, commonly past leaders and important people.  Each community had their own ancestral pantheon (Ljakke).

In the south and river valley region, where many large family communities existed, the community pantheon would wholly consist of one's own personal ancestors (Qamke), and during the Lower Kingdoms period, the concept was extended such that each person would worship their own specific pantheon of ancestors based on the relationships and deeds of their ancestors.  The mass emigrations during the Great Flood and subsequent Unification of the Central Kingdom caused these beliefs to spread to most northern communities as well.

In the upper river region instead, when other families were integrated into a community, they were inducted into the family.  With the development of larger towns, new residents were encouraged or forced to convert to the pantheon of the local ruler in order to maintain authority.  When Kingdoms formed in the upper river, the king's Royal Pantheon would be worshipped throughout the territory by everyone.

As a result of these different tendencies, the Lower Kingdoms tended to continue the tribal tradition of Elected Kings, while the Upper Kingdoms had a system of Hereditary Monarchy.

### Calendar

Sky observations among the Uhhuononj are rather minimal (astronomy was introduced to the Uhhuononj in the Iron Age from the southern Shechageghern people).  However, natural observations (animal migrations, plant reactions, rains, etc) are common, and along with the tendency of the river to flood after Melts, a solar calendar is devised.

- Seasons of the Year - *qu'ħuśśaix esa* or *qu'ħuśśaëx esa*
  - **Winter** - *Iske* - season of Night - long nights and a period of rest
  - **Spring** - *Rhüźakke* - season of the Melt - when snow falling in the Mountain Springs region (*Jêiśħeimonj*) melts and brings floods, along with increased fertility, downriver.  The First Melt is an important annual celebration.
  - **Summer** - *Kusko* - season of Plenty - where fruits and berries begin to ripen and early harvests bring plenty of food to the table.
  - **Autumn** - *Ħusko* - season of Harvest - where the main annual crops are harvested and communities chip in to help harvest and prepare for winter.  The First Harvest and Final Harvest are important annual celebrations.

### Weather

The weather, domain of the deity *Tfencikke*, is controlled by her child and 5 grandchildren, birds which reside in different environments bringing these conditions to the land.  They are:

- **Vaśnjaontśko** - the Mother Bird, residing in the sky and calming her children, thus calming the weather/winds
- **Vônjoutśko** - the Frost Bird, residing in the frozen Northlands, bringing cold, dry winds when agitated
- **Ħanjmitśko** - the Flame Bird, residing in the scorching Cursed Desert, bringing hot, dry winds when agitated
- **Verxotśko** - the Rain Bird, residing in the northwestern seas, periodically bringing cool, wet winds
- **Pâenjattśko** - the Storm Bird, residing in the southwestern seas, bringing strong winds and storms when agitated
- **Ghâeñoyattśko** - the Mountain Bird, residing in the eastern mountains, never getting agitated

## Worship and Festivity

Each community worships the gods and their ancestors differently, however there are some common/widespread celebrations.

Agricultural celebrations dedicated to the *Tośquoggo* are common in river valley communities.  The most important of these are **The First Melt** (*Vae Rhüge*) and **The Final Harvest** (*Ulfärh Yêrrhâugo*).  **The First Harvest** (*Vae Yêrrhâugo*) is also celebrated in many communities, not just along the river.

### The First Melt - *Vae Rhüge*

*Vae Rhüge* is a celebration that derives from an ancient tradition of welcoming the Spring Messengers.  It is traditional for each community, upon receiving word that the first melting of snow has begun, to send messengers to other communities downstream to warn of the coming floods, allowing them to prepare.  The message originates at the communities living in the Mountain Springs (*Jêiśħeimonj*) and is passed all the way down to the River Coast (*Xärrhättśonj*).  The messengers are termed the Spring Messengers (*Rhüźaindükke*), and are always warmly welcomed even if the respective communities have otherwise bad relations - the tradition plays a vital role in maintaining order in the river valley communities, and no community wants to miss out on receiving the messenger the next year.  This is one of the few celebrations that isn't tied to a specific deity, although it is often associated with *Qu'ħusko* (seasons), *Vaoñdvikke* (travels) and *Yinddźaoge* (day / non-winter).

*Vae Rhüge* is celebrated around the start of spring, the day after the arrival of the first of the Messengers, although the period before that is often used as preparation.  The festivities last for 5 days, though small feasts are often thrown to honour any Messenger who arrives after that time.  The festival is also used as an opportunity for intercommunity diplomacy and to build ties between communities.

### Harvest Festivals

**The First Harvest** (*Vae Yêrrhâugo*) is celebrated among many communities, not just the ones on the river valley.  It is dedicated to both of the *Tośquoggo* and their ancestral representatives, entreating them to grant the community a long and peaceful Autumn in order to have a successful harvest.

**The Final Harvest** (*Ulfärh Yêrrhâugo*) is again primarily celebrated by communities near the river valley, though also by nearby communities in the coastal lands and highlands.  It is dedicated to *Tośquoggo* to thank them for a successful harvest season, and *Ienjaoge* to get on his and his representatives' good sides to avoid their wrath over the Winter.

The two Harvest Festivals are celebrated with feasts and carousal.  The *Tośquoggo* are sometimes revered as God and Goddess of Revelry; other communities revere *Tfencikke* as a Goddess of the Soul / the True Self and believe that drinking to excess allows the Soul/True Self to take control.  

### Ancestor Worship

Each important ancestor is celebrated around once a year around the time of their death, but these celebrations tend to be personal and sombre.  They often involve burning of incense, preparation of a specific dish dear to the person and/or ritualistic consumption of psychoactive substances to commune with them.

Families traditionally maintain shrines to their ancestors, with larger and wealthier families maintaining a family temple as well.  In lower river lands, where each person has their own ancestors, this tradition has become somewhat obsolete and people use common temples to worship their own ancestors.  In upper river kingdoms/the Central Kingdom, all temples have been converted to worship the ruler's ancestral pantheon.  In towns and villages elsewhere, the traditional family shrines remain.

In addition to this, worship of one's ancestors includes acknowledging and praising them every so often.  This praising of ancestors made its way into everyday conversation by the late Bronze Era, with common phrases both praising them and serving some other purpose.  For example, the phrase *ulompëqoñ tśarix qamke qâ* 'your ancestors are wise' is commonly used as a greeting (later shortened to *tśar-lom-ke*); *ħouś X* is used as 'you're welcome', substituting X for the name of one's own ancestors, literally 'X (is) good-natured'.

## Social and Civic Culture

### Urbanisation

- Villages develop into towns and cities in the lower river plains first, fuelled by fertile farmland and easy access to clay brick for construction
- Villages in the upper river valley are next, using the sturdier but much harder to work stone and abundant wood.  After conquering the lower plains, these cities expand rapidly to accomodate a new class of craftspeople, scholars and artists
- Villages away from the river valley mostly remain villages or towns.  Near the river valley they usually pay taxes/contributions in return for protection and certain rights, farther away they are usually independent townships

### Authority

- People swore allegiance to Tribes in the early Bronze era, but as populations grew and villages gained more power, each village tended to break away from the larger tribe and become self-governing.  Tribal allegiances remained strong in the Northlands and remote Highlands, where village development was slower.
- In many early villages, the leader was elected by village elders; in the Lower Kingdoms this was extended as a King was elected for life by a council made up of representatives of certain districts (these districts often had their origin in separate towns); the council members themselves being elected by elders from their own district.
- In the upper river region, the shift of Ancestral Pantheon to the leader meant that the role of leader would naturally pass within the same family, leading naturally to a Hereditary Monarchy in Upper Kingdoms.

### Administration

- Rudimentary records systems spreads from Lower Kingdoms using clay tablets.  Also appears frequently on pottery and bricks
- However, this recording system requires a long process (clay is imprinted, then fired) and only used for official records
- As the capital moves to the Upper River, the use of clay tablets is impractical (as clay must be imported from the Lower River).  Once Ironworking is discovered, relegating Copper to ceremonial use, Copper is used to mint tokens containing symbols to represent a similar system to the clay tablet recordings
- Accounting/Administration techniques are also learnt from Shechageghern traders, allowing businesses and commerce to flourish during the Central Kingdom

### Symbolism

- Royal Colour of the Seadragon Strait (*Śaśśüħênj*) and River Coast (*Xärrhättśonj*) is Purple, derived from crushed seashells
- Royal Colour of the Lower River region (*Puruttśonj*) is Turquoise, derived from minerals containing copper
- Royal Colour of the Upper River region (*Xâeputtśonj*) is Red, derived from certain crushed insects
