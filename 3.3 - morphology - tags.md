# Sentence-Final Tags

This section will detail the use of sentence-final tags, which 'conjugate' for verb tense, aspect, mood and person.  These tags are used in conjunction with (but separate from) verbs and locative pronouns to shape the precise meaning of the verb.

## Mood, Tense and Formality

Tags descend from a generalisation of the Vuhîñkam sentence-final interrogative particle, with different words used in place of the interrogative particle to express different moods.  As such, each mood is expressed using a different tag.  

As the past tense suffix was often moved to the sentence-final particle, it followed onto the new generalised tags early on, producing a distinct form for **past tense (PAST)**, contrasting with the unmodified **non-past tense (NPST)**.

The frequent use of tags served to erode the structure of common tags such that certain tags consist of only a single sound.  In **Formal (FOR)** speech, however, this elision did not occur as much, thus an unelided tag became a marker of formality, contrasting with the shorter tag which was used in **Common (COM)** speech.  Formal tags are used when speaking to people outside one's tribe, in public speaking, in rituals and, in the later River Valley Kingdoms, when performing administrative duties for the crown.

### Moods

There are 9 moods expressible using different tags.  These are:

- Moods with both Non-Past and Past tense
  - **Indicative - IND** - Used for statements, the most commonly used tag.  Note that events which the speaker has not personally witnessed should use the Narrative tag.
  - **Narrative - NAR** - Used for storytelling
    - Narrative Non-past, i.e. Renarrative/Inferential - Used for speaking about specific or recent things which the speaker has learnt about second-hand, used in a Past Tense-like meaning.  Compare Turkish -miş or Balkan Renarrative moods.
    - Narrative Past - Used for speaking about knowledge and for stories 'passed down through generations/ancestors', similar to 'it is said that...'.  Not necessarily Past Tense in meaning, e.g. '(it is said that) birds fly south in winter'
  - **Interrogative - INT** - Used for questions, including Yes/No and question word questions
  - **Conditional-Hypothetical - CON** - Used for statements which are conditional upon something else.  Also used for hypothetical statements, including conditions upon which another conditional statement rests - i.e. in all the following examples, Conditional tags are used for both parts of the sentence.
    - Non-past examples - these two forms are not distinguished
      - 'if he lies, then he is not your friend' (non-past condition, present effect)
      - 'if you come, then you will be rewarded' (present condition, future effect)
      - 'if you were to come, then you would be rewarded' (hypothetical condition, future-of-hypothetical effect)
    - Past example - these two forms are also not distinguished
      - 'if you came, then you would be rewarded' (unknown past state, present effect)
      - 'if you had come, then you would have been rewarded' (counterfactual)
    - If there is no other indication, then consecutive/coordianted Conditional clauses are considered to be Condition > Effect
      - e.g. *qompëñ vâe nji, mu nji*
      - lit. 'eat there CON, here CON'
      - translated as 'if you eat, then I eat'
    - If there is no other indication, a Conditional coordinated with a non-conditional clause will take on the role of Condition
      - e.g. *mâenjârâ mu nju', qompëñ vâe vâur*
        - lit. 'come here CON.you, eat there NEC'
        - translated as 'if you come here, you should eat!'
      - e.g. *qompëñ mu vâur, vâe nji*
        - lit. 'eat here COM, there CON'
        - translated as 'I will/intend to eat if you eat'
  - **Necessitative - NEC** - Used for things which would in English begin with 'it would be good if...' or contain 'should'.  Past tense is counterfactual, as in 'it would have been good if...' or 'should have'
- Moods with no Past tense
  - **Imperative - IMP** - Used for commands.  A polite form of the imperative also exists for 'soft commands' or requests; these share the same intonation as Interrogative (questions) and are usually also marked with a question mark.
  - **Prohibitive -- PRH** - Used for prohibitions / negative commands.  No polite form exists, instead use the Imperative and negate the verb.
  - **Speculative -- SPC** - Used to speculate about future events out of one's control - e.g. he might come tomorrow, it might rain tomorrow - or past/current events whose state we are unsure of - e.g. he might be coming now, it might be raining over there.
  - **Commissive -- COM** - Used to state non-past intentions or speak about future events which one has some control over - I will go there; it will happen (I will make it happen/make sure it happens).  Can be combined with other tags to speak about past intentions.
    - The 'committer' is necessarily the topic of this tag.  If the sentence as a whole has a different topic, then this tag should use a suffix for the 'committer' in order to keep its meaning.  An extra tag may be added to accomplish this.
    - *qunyiśnjef mu vâurmotśarh* - 'I will fight you'
    - *qunyiśnjef mu tśarh vâurmo qâtśarh* - 'You, I will fight'

### Forms

The tag forms are given below.  Some tags have optional final vowels, used when the next suffix starts with a consonant (or when used alone for one-syllable tags), or optional final consonants, used when the next suffix starts with a vowel.  The pronunciation will include optional/elidable sounds.  Note that some tags are stressed while others are not.

Note that tags can be chained in order to make use of multiple ones.  Usually only the final tag is conjugated, although person suffixes can attach to earlier tags to mark topic if required.  For example, if asking for someone to speculate, one can use either 'eat SPC-he-it INT-you' or 'eat it SPC INT-you-him' to mean 'do you think he's eating it'.

## Conjugation

The tag forms above can take a number of agglutinative suffixes, these suffixes cause minimal changes to the base tag and do not take stress (although they can be stressed informally if too many unstressed syllables occur in a row).  Suffixes include aspect and person.

### Aspect suffixes

The exact meaning of aspect suffixes changes depending on whether the verb used is Perfective or Imperfective.  Aspect suffixes always appear before person suffixes; use of multiple aspect suffixes is allowed and common.  They may change form depending on front/back vowel of the attaching tag, while a glottal stop is inserted to break hiatuses between aspect suffixes and verb tags - optional vowel and optional stop are both dropped if they both exist, e.g. q(â) + (')anj > qanj.  Suffixes always appear the following order:

- lji/ljë
  - (not technically an aspect, but it fits in the suffix category)
  - Both verb roots >> **Causative (CAUS)** (make do, cause to do)
    - meħħonj mu qâ '(I) dig here' >> meħħonj mu qâljë '(I) make (someone/thing) dig here / cause...to dig'
    - meħħaonje mu qâ '(I am) digging here' >> meħħaonje mu qâljë '(I) make (something) be digging here / cause...to be digging'
- (')anj
  - Perfective >> **Habitual (HAB)** (sometimes/often do)
    - meħħonj mu qâ '(I) dig here' >> meħħonj mu qanj '(I) (sometimes/often) dig here'
  - Imperfective >> **Inchoative (INCH)** (start to do)
    - meħħaonje mu qâ '(I) am digging here' >> meħħaonje mu qanj '(I) start to dig here'
- fä
  - Perfective >> **Delimitative (DELIM)** (do a bit)
    - meħħonj mu qâ '(I) dig here' >> meħħonj mu qâfä '(I) dig here a bit'
  - Imperfective >> **Terminative (TERM)** (stop/finish doing)
    - meħħaonje mu qâ '(I) am digging here' >> meħħaonje mu qâfä '(I) stop/finish digging here'

### Person suffixes

Person suffixes on tags are optional, but usually used if the person doesn't correspond to the locative used (see section Locative Semantics in 3.2)

- There are 2 distinct uses for person suffixes - Argument/Topic and Vocative
  - **Argument suffixes** are used to reinforce or specify the arguments of a verb.  They use Nominative for the subject/agent and Accusative for the object/patient of the verb (even if the object itself is in another case).  If one of these arguments a Topic, then this one goes first; otherwise order is free.  By promoting the verb object to Topic position a passive-like construction can be formed.  The suffix marking the topic can be stressed or emphasised if required.
    - *qompëñ mu* >>
      - *... qâ* '(I/We) eat here' (IND)
      - *... qâghâ* 'We eat here' (IND-1p.NOM)
      - *... quyyêr* 'You eat it here' (IND-2s.NOM-3I.ACC)
      - *... ħaoñma quyyêr* 'You eat bread here' (IND-2s.NOM-3I.ACC)
      - *... ħaoñma qâyêru'* 'Bread is eaten here by you' (IND-3I.ACC-2s.NOM)
  - **Vocative suffixes** are used to address the sentence to someone.  They always use the Nominative form and always come last.  They are indistinguishable from nominative argument suffixes when placed last, though context is usually enough to clear it up.  A tag may include both a Nominative Argument *and* a Vocative suffix, in which case the final one is the vocative.
    - *qompëñ mu qu'* 'You eat here' OR 'Hey you, (I/We) eat here'
    - *qompëñ mu qu'u'* 'Hey you, you eat here.'

Note that the final glottal stop of 2s.PRI *u'* assimilates to any following suffixes, e.g. *u' + fê* > *uffê*.

|Person| Nominative |IPA       | Accusative |IPA       |
|------|------------|----------|------------|----------|
| 1s   | mo         | /mɔ/     | fê         | /fe/     |
| 1p   | ghâ        | /ɣʌ/     | pô         | /po/     |
| 2s   | u'         | /uʔ/     | tśarh      | /c͡ɕær̥/   |
| 2d   | ljarh      | /ʎær̥/    | râm        | /rʌm/    |
| 2p   | me         | /mɛ/     | źiñ        | /ʑiɴ/    |
| 3I   | qâ         | /ɢʌ/     | yêr        | /ɟer/    |
| 3As  | qenjh      | /ɢɛɲ̊/    | yênjh      | /ɟeɲ̊/    |
| 3Ap  | ñenjh      | /ɴɛɲ̊/    | venjh      | /ʋɛɲ̊/    |
| 3Hs  | qonj       | /ɢɔɲ/    | yênj       | /ɟeɲ/    |
| 3Hd  | rjonj      | /rjɔɲ/   | ghonj      | /ɣɔɲ/    |
| 3Hp  | ñânj       | /ɴʌɲ/    | vonj       | /ʋɔɲ/    |
| 3D   | ñix        | /ɴix/    | veħ        | /ʋɛħ/    |
