# Vocab Notes

This section is just for some miscellaneous notes on the provided vocab table.

## Listing Notes

Columns are:

- Uhhuonanjh word
- Pronunciation
- Part of speech
- English translation
  - similar meanings are separated by a SLASH /
  - distinct meanings are listed on a new line
- English explanation and notes, including
  - extra possible translations if they don't fit in the translation column
  - clarification of the word meaning
  - EG - an example phrase or sentence to give context to the transltion
  - REG - regular / expected form of the word, if it didn't quite follow expected sound changes.  This form may still be in use as a formal version of the word.
  - FROM - if the word is derived from a contemporary Uhhuonanjh word, it will be listed here
  - ORIG - the original meaning of the word, if it has shifted during the evolution
  - CF - words which may share some etymology, even if the exact relation is unclear

Verb stems will be listed separately where irregular; they will be listed consecutively if still considered to be the same 'word' though.  Verbs with entirely irregular stems will have each stem listed separately (though PART and PERF may be combined into a single V-PP if they share a form).  Verbs with some regular stems will be listed in their positive participle PART form with a Part of Speech 'V'; any unlisted verb stem can then be regularly derived (through PART + qu-, -e/-o and -ef/-of).

Within themes, the order will generally be Verbs, Nouns, Adjectives, Adverbs/other.  Derived words will have their own entry with a note of their origin.
