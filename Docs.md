# 1: Introduction to Uħħuonanjh

**Uħħuonanjh** /ˈuħˌħuo̯næɲ̊/ is the language spoken during the Bronze and Iron Ages by the **Uħħuononj** /ˈuħˌħuo̯nɔɲ/ people.  The Uħħuononj, one of three groups descended from the Vuhîñkam, descend from the people who chose to stay in the Vuhînkam homeland rather than migrate outwards (the others being Shechageghern and *Proto-TypUserian).  The prevailing mythology among the Uħħuononj explains this as dedication to their ancestors resting in the ground below them, though this hasn't stopped the people from migrating outwards from the river valley.

The words *Uħħuononj* and *Uħħuonanjh* simply mean 'tribe' and 'language spoken by a tribe' respectively - the Uħħuononj as a whole were never a united people and there was no specific word to denote them as a group as opposed to other groups.

Most of the Uħħuononj were concentrated in the *Uonjëkkouonj* /ˈuo̯ɲɤkˌkou̯ɔɲ/ region (the river valley) and its surrounds, known variably as *Qamkonj* /ˈɢæm̥kɔɲ/ 'Land of Ancestors', *Ljiħħeimonj* /ˈʎiħˌħei̯mɔɲ/ 'Land of Birth' or *Kuskonj* /ˈkuskɔɲ/ 'Land of Plenty'.  The major river is known as the *Vônvënjh* /ˈʋonʋɤɲ̊/.

## Overview Timeline

- Late Neolithic - Shechageghern migration
- Early Bronze Age - Cities form in the Lower Valley (*Puruttśonj* and *Xärrhättśonj* regions)
- Early-Mid Bronze Age - Cities form in the Upper Valley (*Xâeputtśonj*); Kingdoms (*vakkeħħonj*) form in the Lower Valley region
- Mid Bronze Age - Lower Kingdoms come to dominate the entire *Qamkonj* (homeland) region, building new cities in the region but also triggering local tribes to migrate further afield
- Late Bronze Age - A combination of invasions and catastrophic floods decimates the Lower Kingdoms, leading to the creation of Upper Valley kingdoms as well as a large emigration from the Lower Valley towards lands outside the *Qamkonj* (homelands).
- Early Iron Age - The discovery of ironworking propels one particular kingdom in the Upper Valley to harness it for military use, quickly subjugating its neighbours and then unifying the entire *Uonjëkkouonj* (river valley) into the *Fieggeħħuogo* (Central/Divine Kingdom).
- Mid Iron Age - The *Fieggeħħuogo* Kingdom continues to expand through the *Qamkonj* (homeland) region and beyond.  They are able to expand rapidly through the south, but are unable to expand very far north and east due to thick forests and difficult terrain.
- Late Iron Age - Political troubles, droughts and foreign invasions in the *Fieggeħħuogo* Kingdom lead to its fracture into a number of separate states and a long period of chaos, during which a large portion of *Qamkonj* inhabitants emigrate northward.

## Interaction

Little direct contact with Proto-TU, most trade and contact was done through Shechageghern intermediaries.

Trade routes between Uħħuonanj and Shechageghern lands were common.

# 2: Phonology and Romanisation

This section will present the phonology and romanisation of the language.

Note that as a language without a formal writing system, there is no 'official orthography'.  The romanisation system is a mostly 1-1 correspondance with pronunciation with a number of simplifications.

## Phonological Inventory

[back to chapter top](#2-phonology-and-romanisation)

### Vowel Inventory

There are 12 monophthongs and 13 diphthongs in the language, although /uɪ̯/ is commonly considered a 'simple' vowel along with the monophthongs, making 13 simple vowels and 12 complex vowels.  

These are also split into 12 back vowels, 12 front vowels and 1 central vowel, with an equal distribution of simple and complex vowels; coming to 6 of each for simple back, complex back, simple front and complex front vowels, along with 1 central vowel.

|height| simple front | complex front | central | simple back | complex back |
|---------|-------|---------|---|--------|---------|
|close    |/i/ /y/|/ie̯/     |   |/uɪ̯/ /u/|/uo̯/     |
|close-mid|/e/ /ø/|/ei̯/ /øʊ̯/|   |/ɤ/ /o/ |/ɤɪ̯/ /ou̯/|
|open-mid |/ɛ/    |/eɐ̯/     |   |/ʌ/ /ɔ/ |/oɐ̯/     |
|open     |/æ/    |/æɪ̯/ /æo̯/|/ä/|        |/ɑʊ̯/ /ɑe̯/|

### Consonant Inventory

There are 37 consonant phonemes in the language, organised into 5 general places of articulation.

All consonants may be geminated, though it is only common for stops, fricatives and trills.

|type       |labial |alveolar |palatal  |velar  |uvular-laryngeal|
|-----------|-------|---------|---------|-------|-------|
|nasal      |/m̥/ /m/|/n̥/ /n/  |/ɲ̊/ /ɲ/  |       |/ɴ̥/ /ɴ/|
|stop       |/p/ /b/|/t/ /d/  |/c/ /ɟ/  |/k/ /g/|/ʔ/ /ɢ/|
|affricate  |       |/t͡ʃ/ /d͡ʒ/|/c͡ɕ/ /ɟ͡ʑ/|       |       |
|fricative  |/f/    |/s/ /z/  |/ɕ/ /ʑ/  |/x/ /ɣ/|/ħ/    |
|approximant|/ʋ/    |/ɹ/      |/j/      |       |       |
|lateral apx|       |/l/      |/ʎ/      |       |       |
|trill      |       |/r̥/ /r/  |         |       |       |

- Voiced and unvoiced nasals and trills are found in complimentary distribution in most clusters, but are distinguished between vowels and morpheme-finally.  Voiced and unvoiced nasals are beginning to merge.
- The two trills are a result of a merger between earlier alveolar and guttural trills.  The resulting phoneme is realised differently among different areas - /r/ can be realised variously as \[r ~ ɾ], \[ɽ], \[ʐ], \[ʀ], \[ʁ], etc.
- The exact pronunciation of the postalveolar affricates /t͡ʃ/ and /d͡ʒ/ varies.  In addition to being pronounced as written, they may also be alveolar \[t͡s] \[d͡z], retroflex \[t͡ʂ] \[d͡ʐ] (reflecting earlier pronunciation) or may merge with palatal.
- /f/ and /ʋ/ are labiodental and assimilate adjacent bilabials to labiodentals.  /ʋ/ can sometimes be vocalised to \[ʊ ~ ʏ], especially when sandwiched in the middle of clusters/word-finally, e.g. /ˈmɛʔɔdʋ/ > \[ˈmɛʔɔdʊ]; /ˈɢæo̯rdʋɲæ/ > \[ˈɢæo̯rdʏɲæ]
- Uvular nasals will assimilate to nearby velars, becoming \[ŋ̊] \[ŋ].
- Glottal stop /ʔ/ can assimilate to nearby consonants, though in careful speech this is avoided.
- Most dialects assimilate voicing of nasals and trills when not otherwise assimilated in clusters (usually across morpheme boundaries), e.g. /ɴɛɲ̊/ + /ɟeɲ/ > \[ɴɛɲɟeɲ]

## Romanisation

[back to chapter top](#2-phonology-and-romanisation)

### Vowels

In writing, vowel diphthongs are not distinguished from vowels in hiatus, though they are in pronunciation; for example 'ea', while usually signifying the diphthong /eɐ̯/, can sometimes refer instead to 2 separate vowels /e.æ/.

|phoneme|written|phoneme|written|phoneme|written|phoneme|written|
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| /i/   | i     | /y/   | ü     | /uɪ̯/  | ui    | /u/   | u     |
| /e/   | ê     | /ø/   | ö     | /ɤ/   | ë     | /o/   | ô     |
| /ɛ/   | e     | /æ/   | a     | /ʌ/   | â     | /ɔ/   | o     |
| /ie̯/  | ie    | /ei̯/  | ei    | /uo̯/  | uo    | /ou̯/  | ou    |
| /øʊ̯/  | eu    | /eɐ̯/  | ea    | /ɤɪ̯/  | oi    | /oɐ̯/  | oa    |
| /æɪ̯/  | ai    | /æo̯/  | ao    | /ɑʊ̯/  | âu    | /ɑe̯/  | âe    |
| /ä/   | ä     |       |       |       |       |       |       |

### Consonants

Voiced and unvoiced nasals are not distinguished in writing unless word-final, in which case the unvoiced nasals have an extra following 'h'.

Palatal digraphs with J, /ɲ̊/, /ɲ/ and /ʎ/, are written without the J when preceding another palatal consonant.  Unvoiced trill /r̥/ is written simply as R preceding another marked unvoiced consonant, including itself (i.e. excluding nasals).

|phoneme |written|phoneme |written|phoneme |written|phoneme |written|
|--------|-------|--------|-------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
|/m̥/, /m/| m     |/n̥/, /n/| n     |/ɲ̊/, /ɲ/| nj    |/ɴ̥/, /ɴ/| ñ     |
| /p/    | p     | /b/    | b     | /f/    | f     | /ʋ/    | v     |

## Prosody

[back to chapter top](#2-phonology-and-romanisation)

**Stress** is noticeable but rarely phonemic; very few minimal pairs exist for stress.  Stress primarily exists as a marker of word separation.  Most words have up to 2 stressed syllables by default, although certain affixes carry their own stress.  Speech is primarily stress-timed.  Pitch changes are also noticeable in the language, but entirely tied to stress.

The first stress of a word root is the Primary Stress, realised with a high pitch and high volume, or mid-high pitch when no secondary stress is present.  Every other stress is a Secondary Stress, this is realised with a low pitch and equally high volume, or mid-low when another secondary stress follows.  Syllables after the primary and before a secondary stress tend to carry mid-high pitch; all other unstressed syllables carry a mid to mid-low pitch.  Some affixes carry their own Primary Stress, though this is rare (mostly derivational affixes).  An example of stress and pitch:

- Quoźo'âenquëx quo'onjëx fesqampondoxkou
  - 'to the family/ies of the couple from The Twin Rivers'
  - /ˈɢuo̯ʑɔˌʔɑe̯nɢuɤx ˈɢuo̯ʔɔɲɤx ˈfɛsˌɢæm̥pɔnˌdɔxkou̯/
  - /ˈɢuo̯˥ʑɔ˦ˌʔɑe̯n˩ɢu˧ɤx˧ ˈɢuo̯˦ʔɔ˧ɲɤx˧ ˈfɛs˥ˌɢæm̥˨pɔn˧ˌdɔx˩kou̯˧/

Sentence final tags can sometimes contain long strings with no stress; instead stress is inserted wherever necessary, sometimes to emphasise certain points but often arbitrarily.  These 'informal stresses' are generally somewhat softer than secondary stress.

## Phonotactics

[back to chapter top](#2-phonology-and-romanisation)

The maximum syllable size is CLLVCL, with only the central V mandatory.  Most syllables are maximally CLVC, the extra CL occurs due to the split of Vuhinkam affricate TS into TF/DV.  Words generally cannot end in any stops or affricates other than the glottal stop.

Primary stress *usually* occurs on the first syllable of a word (barring prefixes), although this is not always the case, especially with *vowel + geminated trill* word initials.  Similarly, secondary stress *usually* occurs on the penultimate syllable of words with more than 3 syllables, but again this is not always the case due to merged or inserted syllables.

Front stressed syllables tend to lead to fronting of back vowels while Back stressed syllables tend to lead to backing of front vowels, though many historical vowels resisted these changes and vowel harmony is particularly strict.  Certain suffixes have both front and back variants - depending on the dialect, these will change either depending on the final vowel or on the last stressed vowel.  If required to agree with central vowel Ä /ä/, these affixes may change arbitrarily and either form would be considered correct.

## Alternations

[back to chapter top](#2-phonology-and-romanisation)

Over the course of phonological evolution, some words picked up an unstressed prefix before an initial trill (note that some initial trills were generated *after* this process and thus don't have one).  This prefix is removed when a prefix is added to the word.  Example: *yiñ + (ar)rhanjh* 'pre- + standing' >> *yiñrhanjh*

# 3.1: Morphology - Nouns

This section will present the morphology of nouns in the language, including personal pronouns.

Sections (or [back to top](#chapters)):

- [Inflection](#inflection)
- [Inflection Paradigms](#inflection-paradigms)
- [Determiners](#determiners)
- [Pronouns](#pronouns)

## Inflection

[back to chapter top](#31-morphology---nouns)

Nouns belong to one of 4 classes and inflect for number and case.  These inflections take the form of suffixes.

### Classes and Number

Noun classes are inherited from Vuhîñkam, with Inanminate (I/INAN), Animate (A/ANIM) and Divine (D/DIVN).  The Animate class is separated into two, creating a new Human class (H/HUMN).

The distinctions between number varies between class.  Inanimate and Divine do not distinguish number at all, Animate distinguishes Singular (s/sn) and Plural (p/pl), while Human has a 3-way distinction between Singular, Dual (d/dl) and Plural.

The distinction between classes is mostly morphological.  A word can be 'converted' ad hoc to another class by tacking on the appropriate ending, with the effect of objectifying, animating, anthropomorphising or deifying the referent.

Endings for each class are:

- **Inanmiate** - no ending.  Nominative ends in -te or -to, but the dictionary form given is the Accusative for these nouns.
- **Animate** - vowel + -njh /ɲ̊/
- **Human** - vowel + voiced nasal
- **Divine** - -ke /kɛ/, -ge /gɛ/, -ko /kɔ/, -go /gɔ/

### Cases

Nouns (in general) inflect for 5 cases.  For more detail on the use of cases, see "4.2 - Syntax - Noun Phrases".

- **NOM** - Nominative case - used for the subject or agent of a verb; also used for both sides of a copula sentence and for disjoint/topical/vocative use.
- **ACC** - Accusative case - used for the object or direct patient of a verb.
- **DAT** - Dative case - used for attribute, motion, direction or action *towards* the noun.  Commonly used for objects of verbs where the object itself is not changed, e.g. 'he sees the tree'.
- **GEN** - Genitive case - used for attribute, motion, direction or action *of/from/due to* the noun.
- **LOC** - Locative case - used for attribute, motion, position or action *at/in/during/with/by/using* the noun.  

The Vuhîñkam Instrumentative case and Locative case have merged into one (except in postpositions).

While cases are often used by themselves, they can also be accompanied by a **postposition** to form a postpositional phrase.  These are detailed in doc 4.2.

## Inflection Paradigms

[back to chapter top](#31-morphology---nouns)

Inflections often have 2 forms for Front and Back vowels.  The two main strategies for choosing forms are either via the final vowel or the final *stressed* vowel - this varies by dialect.  The examples given in this doc vary by final vowel.

### Adding Class Inflection

Class inflections can be 'added' to words in certain situations, such as in regular/ad hoc formation of new words or when deriving forms for demonstrative and indefinite pronouns.  When converting from an existing class, the ending is usually stripped, but ad hoc derivations often keep them.  In either case, class endings are added in a specific way, dependent on the current ending:

- **Inanmiate** - Nominative end in -te or -to, Accusative adds no endings
- **Animate**
  - vowel final words > -njh /ɲ̊/
  - consonant final words > -enjh /ɛɲ̊/ or -onjh /ɔɲ̊/
- **Human**
  - vowel final words > -nj /ɲ/
  - consonant final words > -onj /ɔɲ/
- **Divine**
  - vowel or voiced consonant final words > -ge /gɛ/ or -go /gɔ/
  - unvoiced consonant final words > -ke /kɛ/ or -ko /kɔ/
    - glottal stop assimilates to K, producing -kke or -kko

### Inanimate Class

Example nouns: *püañh* 'meat stew' (front vowel) and *tuñgo* 'sorghum grain' (back vowel)

The Locative case ending derives from the old Instrumental case ending, instead of the Locative case ending for all other classes.

|case|ending              | example A | IPA         | example B | IPA        |
|----|------------        |-----------|-------------|-----------|------------|
|NOM | -te, -to           | püañte    | /ˈpyæɴ̥tɛ/   | tuñgoto   | /ˈtuɴgɔtɔ/ |
|ACC | no ending          | püañh     | /ˈpyæɴ̥/     | tuñgo     | /ˈtuɴgɔ/   |

|LOC | -êra, -ôra         | püañêra   | /ˈpyæɴ̥eræ/  | tuñgoôra  | /ˈtuɴgɔoræ/|

Words with a final glottal stop interact with the suffix to give slightly different inflections.  Example noun: *qâ* 'what'

|case |ending          | word     | IPA       |
|-----|----------------|----------| --------- |

### Human Class

Example nouns: *źñärhên* 'miner' (front vowel) and *uttum* 'netmaker/fisher' (back vowel)

Capital 'N' in the following table stands for whichever nasal exists in the original root

The Dative Singular case ending derives from an inversion of the usual suffix order from expected class-case -ân-êter/-ânter > *nyêrh to case-class -êter-ân/-êtrân > -(i)nenj

- Example nouns:  
  - *qamke* /ˈɢæm̥kɛ/ '(personal) ancestor'
  - *ghâudokko* /ˈɣɑʊ̯ˌdɔkkɔ/ 'deity'
  - *ghu'iegge* /ˈɣuʔˌie̯ggɛ/ 'medicinal honey'
  - *zuñgo* /ˈzuɴgɔ/ 'eulogy'

Divine class nouns ending vary by un/voiced and simple/geminate stop, back/front vowel, giving 8 possible endings.  To inflect, follow the attributes of the base noun.  The Locative case is the only case which changes depending on gemination.

## Determiners

[back to chapter top](#31-morphology---nouns)

Determiners go before the noun; agreement varies with each class of determiner.

Personal (or interrogative) pronouns in the Genitive case are used as possessive determiners (my, your, whose, etc)

Determiners may be used to modify pronouns in the same way as nouns.  When used for 1st and 2nd person pronouns, they assume the Human class (even if the referent is not human).

### Demonstratives and Interrogatives

Demonstratives (including the interrogative/infinitive determiner) inflect to agree with the noun's Class and Number.

There are 3 levels of proximity for definite determiners (and in general throughout the language) - Proximal (This), Medial (That) and Distal (That over there), correponding to an area close to the speaker, close to the listener and far from both, respectively.  However these frames of reference are only approximate; the choice of proximity level is a purely semantic one.

Along with these proximity levels there is an additional Interrogative / Indefinite level (which / what / whichever), concerting things at an unknown or irrelevant location / distance.  These 4 levels are also in use for locative pronouns.

|Meaning|Inanimate  |Animate       |Human        |Divine           |
|-------|---------- |-------       |-----        |------           |

| INT   |qâmtox /ˈqʌm̥tɔx/   |qâemqënj /ˈqɑe̯mɢɤɲ/ |qâemyox /ˈqɑe̯mɟɔx/ |

### Quantifiers and Numbers

Quantifiers agree only for the noun's Class, while Numbers are always invariant.  Marking number on the noun is optional when these determiners are used; generally only being used to emphasise the pluralness of the modified noun.  Thus *kfanjh ħeianjh* 'many pigs' is more commonly used compared to *kfanjh ħeiancex*.

Note that there is little distinction between mass and countable nouns, so there are no different words for countable vs uncountable nouns or grammatical restrictions on the use of these words with 'uncountable' nouns.

The 'Indefinite quantifier' can mean either 'some X' (as in 'some person') or 'any X'.  Deriving from *rhe* 'one', it shares a form when modifying inanimate nouns, thus *rhe tfaśśa* can mean either 'one tree' or 'any tree/some tree'.

|Meaning| English eg |Inanimate    |Animate         |Human           |Divine           |
|-------| ---------- |----------   |-------         |-----           |------           |

|---------------- |--------------------       |
| xieñ püante     | some meat stew (I)        |
| xeñh ħâeljonjh  | some insects (A)          |
| qvâenj uttuñaħ  | with no fishers (H.LOC)   |
| qaikke qamkêrh  | to every ancestor (D.DAT) |
| ljêr qamke      | five ancestors (D)        |
| ljêr źñärhênjix | from five miners (H.GEN)  |

## Pronouns

[back to chapter top](#31-morphology---nouns)

Uħħuonanjh is pro-drop, meaning it tends to drop pronouns when allowed.  There are two areas where redundancy can cause a pronoun to be dropped, although in general any pronoun (or noun phrase) can be dropped if enough context is given:

- Locative pronouns (covered in the section 3.3 - Verbs in morphology) combined with context often provide enough information for subject pronouns to be dropped - along the lines of 'here (I) hold a pen'.  Note that locative pronouns are required for certain verb forms.
- Sentence-final tags often conjugate for both nominative and accusative arguments, meaning that Nominative and Accusative pronouns are able to be dropped

### Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns have 2 distinct forms for Nominative and Accusative, while other case forms are derived from the Accusative form.  In addition to case, these pronouns inflect for number and noun class for the 3rd person.

2nd and 3rd person pronouns have a Dual number, whose meaning has shifted to a singular referent of that person plus the speaker - thus 2nd person Dual is 'Thou and I' while 3rd person (Human) Dual is 'S/he/it and I'.

The pronouns for 3As (3rd person Animate singular) and 3Hs (3rd person Human singular) in DAT/DEN/LOC cases coincide, but are distinguished by an unvoiced nasal in the Animate vs a voiced nasal in the Human one.  However, these phonemes have begun to merge in many varieties, as a result they are often pronounced similarly if not identically.

|Person| NOM         | ACC           | DAT      | GEN     | LOC     |
|-----|------------- |---------------|--------  |-------- |-------- |
| 1s  | mvo /ˈmʋɔ/   | fea /ˈfeɐ̯/    | fêrh     | fix     | faħ     |

| 3D  |ñikke /ˈɴikkɛ/|vehke /ˈʋɛħkɛ/ | vehkêrh  | vehkix  | vehkaħ  |

### Demonstrative and Interrogative Pronouns

Demonstrative determiners (as listed above) can be used without a modified noun as a *demonstrative pronoun* (similar to English 'That house is red' vs 'That is red').  Ambiguities (whether the demonstrative modifies a noun or acts as a pronoun when a noun follows it) are usually rectified by sentence-final tag conjugations, or by inserting a pause in speech.  Demonstrative pronouns inflect for case, taking regular case endings (including mutating the final nasal for Animate/Human).

In anaphoric use, Proximal (this) pronouns generally correspond to something said before (usually right before), Medial (that) pronouns to something yet to be said (usually right after) and Distal (over there) pronouns to something said some time ago.  A Proximal pronoun referring to a previous sentence is a common way to express sentences of the type 'because X, so Y' (where Y would be the main clause), whereas a Medial pronoun can be used with no antecedent to anticipate the next sentence for the type 'X, because Y' (where X would be the main clause).

The above interrogative pronoun can be used in the same way as the demonstrative pronouns (what / who / which one).  Some forms are given here with English equivalents.  Note that the interrogative pronoun should take the relevant class if a particular response is expected (e.g. Human class for people, Animate class for animals and other 'animate' words, etc); if unknown then use Inanimate.

| Meaning                                   | Word     |Class   |Case |
|------------------------                   |----------|--------|-----|
| what                                      | qâtto    | INAN   | NOM |
| what                                      | qâ'      | INAN   | ACC |
| to what, where, til when, for what reason | qântôrh  | INAN   | DAT |

| to whom, for whom                         | qâenonj  | HUMN   | DAT |
| from whom, because of whom                | qâenjëx  | HUMN   | GEN |
| with whom                                 | qâeñaħ   | HUMN   | LOC |
| which 2 people                            | qâemqënj | HUMN.d | NOM |
| who (H.plur)                              | qâemyox  | HUMN.p | NOM |
| what (D)                                  | qâkke    | DIVN   | NOM |

There are also special interrogative pronouns that can be used instead for specific meanings.  These special pronouns are considered to already be inflected in **Locative** case and **Inanmiate** class, thus they can't take extra inflections and modifiers (adjectives and determiners) must agree with these.

|Meaning|Word |
|-------|---- |
| where | qe  |
| when  | qo  |
| how   | qei |

### Indefinite Pronouns

Similar to demonstrative/interrogative pronouns above, quantifiers can also be used as *indefinite pronouns*.  Using the appropriate class form, they also inflect for case and number.  Numbers can also be used, taking on class endings.  Some examples are given below.

|Meaning            |Word         |Class |Case |
|-------------------|-------------|------|-----|
| everything        | qeaħte      | INAN | NOM |
| everything        | qeaħ        | INAN | ACC |
| to everything     | qeaħenjêrh  | INAN | DAT |
| from everything   | qeaħix      | INAN | GEN |
| (at) everywhere   | qeaħêra     | INAN | LOC |
| everything (A)    | qeanjh      | ANIM | NOM |
| everyone          | qaonj       | HUMN | NOM |
| everyone          | qaoñgeu     | HUMN | ACC |
| to everyone       | qaonenj     | HUMN | DAT |
| from everyone     | qaonjix     | HUMN | GEN |
| with everyone     | qaoñaħ      | HUMN | LOC |
| everything (D)    | qaikke      | DIVN | NOM |
| five (things)     | ljêrte      | INAN | NOM |
| five (things)     | ljêr        | INAN | ACC |
| five (things) (A) | ljêrenjh    | ANIM | NOM |
| five (people)     | ljêrenj     | HUMN | NOM |
| to five (people)  | ljêrenenj   | HUMN | DAT |
| five (things) (D) | ljêrge      | DIVN | NOM |

The corresponding meaning of each quantifier is as follows:

| Quantifier   | Meaning                    | INAN-ACC  |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | --------- |
| No           | Nothing, No-one            | quś       |
| Less         | Less things, Less people   | quto      |

# 3.2: Morphology - Verbs

This section will detail verb morphology, including locative pronouns which play a large part in that.

The following chapter, 3.3, gives details about sentence-final Tags, another crucial element to the verb's meaning.

Sections (or [back to top](#chapters)):

- [Verb Roots](#verb-roots)
- [Locative Pronouns](#locative-pronouns)

## Verb Roots

[back to chapter top](#32-morphology---verbs)

As the language evolved, the verb system became increasingly complex and unwieldy as affixes were added to the verb from both sides, changing its structure, and after drastic sound changes some of these different verb forms became almost unrecognisable.  To simplify this, the language merged many of the different verb forms and shifted conjugations to other parts of the sentence, primarily Locative Pronouns and Sentence-Final Tags.

Uħħuonanjh now distinguishes 4 roots for the verb itself - **Participle (PART), Negative Participle (NEG.PART), Perfective (PERF) and Imperfective (IMPF)**.  These roots are sometimes quite different among themselves and often are considered separate words rather than different forms of a single word, especially as the mechanisms to derive them no longer exist.  For more information on the different meanings of some verb roots, see Section *5.3 - Syntax - Aspect*.

### Participles

The **Participle** and **Negative Participle** forms function as either inanimate nouns or adjectives, but can themselves be the head of a subordinate clause.  In these uses, the words inflect for case/agreement just like any other noun or adjective.

When used as a noun, Participles represent the action (e.g. 'singing' in 'singing is difficult'), while when used as an adjective, they signal that the noun is 'performing' the action (e.g. 'singing' in 'the singing man').  The Negative Participle is simply the negated form of the Participle (e.g. 'not singing is difficult', 'the not-singing man').  Unlike English, these can still take arguments as a verb (similar to 'the singing-a-song man').

Note that participles are *not required* to take the Inanimate Nominative ending -te/-to when used as such (though it is allowed); on the other hand they *must* take the ending when nominalised - vônvë(to) 'splitting.NOM' (action) vs vônvëto 'splitting thing.NOM'.

Participles can take an ACC suffix (-keu/-kou) for use as a passive participle - ljomë 'creating' vs ljomëkeu '(being) created'.  They can similarly take any other case suffix when the modifying a word which would take that case if included in the relative clause - uirâ xaśonj 'going person (person who is going)' vs uirâñaħ xaśonj 'going-to person (person who someone is going to)'.  Note that the Locative ending used is based on the modified noun - if the participle modifies an inanimate noun taking -êra/ôra endings in LOC, then the participle uses that instead (*uirâôra aħak* 'the house someone is going to'); similarly for postpositions with LOC-INS distinction.

The Participle is derived from the Vuhîñkam verb without any modifications, while the Negative Participle of inherited verbs is derived from the negated form of that verb using the complex infix system - this system itself is no longer productive.  Some examples of inherited participles and their negative counterparts are given below

|English         |Participle |IPA             |Negative Part|IPA             |

The PART and NEG.PART forms of *yatfa* 'to laugh' have merged through sound changes; while in formal language this is maintained, in common speech the negative participle is constructed through the new regular prefix, becoming quyafta /ɢuˈɟætfæ/

For newly-derived or newly-coined verbs, the Negative Participle simply adds qu- (without moving stress).  Colloquially, this form of negation is also used for words with existing counterparts, breaking them up into two separate words, with the original negative often taking on a new meaning.  Some examples:

|English           |Participle |IPA             |Negative Part|IPA             |

### Verbal forms

The **Perfective** and **Imperfective** verb roots form the head of a sentence when paired with a final Tag, with the verb taking on the respective aspect.  These roots do not conjugate or take any affixes other than for new word derivation.

While these forms are less variable than the above participles, they still contain some unpredictable changes and the meanings between Perfective and Imperfective forms are beginning to diverge.

Each pair has a *Base Aspect* which determines its derivation -- Perfective Base verbs have a Perfective form identical to the Participle, while the Imperfective is derived with an additional final vowel or occasionally ñ + vowel.  Imperfective Base verbs derive their Imperfective form through either the addition of a suffix -ñ to the Participle, or more unpredictable mutations usually ending in -anjh, while the Perfective is derived from the Imperfective + suffix -of/-ef.  In all these cases, stress is changed to fit the new pattern (maintaining penultimate position).

For newly derived or coined verbs, the Perfective is formed by the addition of suffix -f/-of/-ef to the Participle, while the Imperfective is formed by the addition of suffix -o/-e.  These suffixes do not trigger stress changes.

### Stem Alternation Patterns: Negative

For inherited verbs, while different stems have become quite difficult to predict, they do generally fall into one of several patterns.  The following is more a guide to what forms to expect for a given verb, it doesn't predict the actual form - use the vocab list for that.

### Stem Alternation Patterns: Ptcp > Perf > Imperf

Generally, Perfective-base verbs will have an identical Participle and Perfective verb form.  The Imperfective is formed with the addition of an stress-changing suffix: usually -(ñ)e/o; -(ñ)a/â after a former uvular trill; this suffix sometimes deletes a final vowel.

### Stem Alternation Patterns: Ptcp > Imperf > Perf

Imperfective-base verbs derive their Imperfective form with one of several methods - a non-stress-changing suffix (often -ñ), altering the last syllable to either insert a k- beginning the syllable (later elided) and/or end with an -njh, or the addition of a stress-changing suffix (often -anjh).  Some Imperfective forms are identical to their participles.

Perfective forms of these words are usually formed with a suffix -ef/of onto the Imperfective form.  This suffix combines with the imperfective ending if possible, meaning it doesn't tend to add stress if the Imperfective suffix already did.

## Locative Pronouns

[back to chapter top](#32-morphology---verbs)

Locative pronouns are simply pronouns which express location at one of the 4 levels of distance (Proximal, Medial, Distal and Indefinite).  These became commonplace during the language's development.  Due to their association with verbs, they have come to take on an additional role of Negative/Emphatic verb marker.  They also appear directly after verbs.  In order to negate a Verbal Form, a Locative Pronoun is used in the Negative.  The emphatic form either places emphasis on the verb (or location), or reinforces the verb, something like 'it definitely/truly/well/actually/for sure happens'.

Locative pronouns are not required for use with Participles, although they can still be used (in which case they appear directly *before* the participle).

Locative pronouns themselves are considered grammatically to be special inanimate pronouns, whose NOM/ACC/LOC forms are all the same, and where the Locative form tends to be used in place of GEN/DAT for most simple adverbial meanings.  However, locative pronouns *can* take inflectional endings for GEN and DAT when used in postpositional phrases (e.g. PRX.GEN = muëx, DST.DAT = minjenjêrh/informally minjêrh).

|Distance|Positive|IPA        |Negative|IPA        |Emphatic|IPA           |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| INF    |quo     |/ˈɢuo̯/     |jêñ     |/ˈjeɴ/     |huñə    |/ˈħuɴɤ/       |
| PRX    |mu      |/ˈmu/      |tsimpü  |/ˈt͡ʃim̥py/  |huomu   |/ˈħuo̯mu/      |
| MED    |vâe     |/ˈʋɑe̯/     |ârvo    |/ˈʌrʋɔ/    |hâuo    |/ˈħɑʊ̯ɔ/       |
| DST    |minj    |/ˈmiɲ/     |ienjinj |/ˈie̯ɲiɲ/   |huomënj |/ˈħuo̯mɤɲ/     |

Examples of verb + locative

- *arrheañef quo* 'to happen / happens somewhere / anywhere'
- *arrheañef tħimpy* 'doesn't happen here/near me'
- *arrheañef hâuo* 'happens there/near you' (emphatic)
- *arrheañ jêñ* 'to not exist / doesn't exist somewhere / anywhere'
- *iccaf minj* 'sows over there/somewhere else'
- *iccae ârvo* 'isn't sowing there/near you'

### Locative Semantics

(More detail to be provided in section 5.4 - Locatives)

While Locative pronouns be themselves simply refer to a location, their common use has attached other pragmatic meanings to them.

One common attached meaning is of topic pronoun, with Proximal referring to a 1st person topic, Medial to a 2nd person topic, Distal to a definite 3rd person topic and Infinitive to an indefinite topic.  This topic can then be dropped if the meaning is clear.

Note that these examples contain final tags to form proper sentences, see the next section for details

- *qompëñ mu qâ*
  - lit. 'eats here'
  - also commonly meaning 'I/we eat' or 'as for me/us, (I/we) eat'
- *qompëñ mu quʔ*
  - lit. 'you.s eat here'
  - also commonly meaning 'with me/us, you eat'
- *qompëñ quo qâ*
  - lit. 'eats somewhere'
  - also commonly meaning 'someone/anyone eats' or 'somewhere, eating happens'

# 3.3: Morphology - Tags

This section will detail the use of the sentence-final function word/marker or Tag, which 'conjugates' for verb tense, aspect, mood and person.  These tags are used in conjunction with (but separate from) verbs and locative pronouns to shape the precise meaning of the verb.

Sections (or [back to top](#chapters)):

- [Mood, Tense and Formality](#mood-tense-and-formality)
- [Aspect and Person Conjugation](#aspect-and-person-conjugation)
- [Examples](#example-verb-locative-tag-sentences)

## Mood, Tense and Formality

[back to chapter top](#33-morphology---tags)

Tags descend from a generalisation of the Vuhîñkam sentence-final interrogative particle, with different words used in place of the interrogative particle to express different moods.  As such, each mood is expressed using a different tag.  

As the past tense suffix was often moved to the sentence-final particle, it followed onto the new generalised tags early on, producing a distinct form for **past tense (PAST)**, contrasting with the unmodified **non-past tense (NPST)**.

The frequent use of tags served to erode the structure of common tags such that certain tags consist of only a single sound.  In **Formal (FOR)** speech, however, this elision did not occur as much, thus an unelided tag became a marker of formality, contrasting with the shorter tag which was used in **Common (COM)** speech.  Formal tags are used when speaking to people outside one's tribe, in public speaking, in rituals and, in the later River Valley Kingdoms, when performing administrative duties for the crown.

### Moods

There are 9 moods expressible using different tags.  These are:

- Moods with both Non-Past and Past tense
  - **Indicative - IND** - Used for statements, the most commonly used tag.  Note that events which the speaker has not personally witnessed should use the Narrative tag.
  - **Narrative - NAR** - Used for storytelling
    - Narrative Non-past, i.e. Renarrative/Inferential - Used for speaking about specific or recent things which the speaker has learnt about second-hand, used in a Past Tense-like meaning.  Compare Turkish -miş or Balkan Renarrative moods.
    - Narrative Past - Used for speaking about knowledge and for stories 'passed down through generations/ancestors', similar to 'it is said that...'.  Not necessarily Past Tense in meaning, e.g. '(it is said that) birds fly south in winter'
  - **Interrogative - INT** - Used for questions, including Yes/No and question word questions
  - **Conditional-Hypothetical - CON** - Used for statements which are conditional upon something else.  Also used for hypothetical statements, including conditions upon which another conditional statement rests - i.e. in all the following examples, Conditional tags are used for both parts of the sentence.
    - Non-past examples - these two forms are not distinguished
      - 'if he lies, then he is not your friend' (non-past condition, present effect)
      - 'if you come, then you will be rewarded' (present condition, future effect)
      - 'if you were to come, then you would be rewarded' (hypothetical condition, future-of-hypothetical effect)
    - Past example - these two forms are also not distinguished
      - 'if you came, then you would be rewarded' (unknown past state, present effect)
      - 'if you had come, then you would have been rewarded' (counterfactual)
    - If there is no other indication, then consecutive/coordianted Conditional clauses are considered to be Condition > Effect
      - e.g. *qompëñ vâe nji, mu nji*
      - lit. 'eat there CON, here CON'
      - translated as 'if you eat, then I eat'
    - If there is no other indication, a Conditional coordinated with a non-conditional clause will take on the role of Condition
      - e.g. *mâenjârâ mu nju', qompëñ vâe vâur*
        - lit. 'come here CON.you, eat there NEC'
        - translated as 'if you come here, you should eat!'
      - e.g. *qompëñ mu vâur, vâe nji*
        - lit. 'eat here COM, there CON'
        - translated as 'I will/intend to eat if you eat'
  - **Necessitative - NEC** - Used for things which would in English begin with 'it would be good if...' or contain 'should'.  Past tense is counterfactual, as in 'it would have been good if...' or 'should have'
- Moods with no Past tense
  - **Imperative - IMP** - Used for commands.  A polite form of the imperative also exists for 'soft commands' or requests; these share the same intonation as Interrogative (questions) and are usually also marked with a question mark.
  - **Prohibitive -- PRH** - Used for prohibitions / negative commands.  No polite form exists, instead use the Imperative.
    - Using the prohibitive still requires the locative pronoun to be negative, however it also allows the loc.pron to be dropped.  The loc.pron is usually maintained only if there is significant distance between the verb and the tag.
      - ljanji (ârvo) śa - use without *ârvo* is more common
      - ljanji (ârvo) ulârrhâ xaśonenj śa - use with *ârvo* is more common
  - **Speculative -- SPC** - Used to speculate about future events out of one's control - e.g. he might come tomorrow, it might rain tomorrow - or past/current events whose state we are unsure of - e.g. he might be coming now, it might be raining over there.
  - **Commissive -- COM** - Used to state non-past intentions or speak about future events which one has some control over - I will go there; it will happen (I will make it happen/make sure it happens).  Can be combined with other tags to speak about past intentions.
    - The 'committer' is necessarily the topic of this tag.  If the sentence as a whole has a different topic, then this tag should use a suffix for the 'committer' in order to keep its meaning.  An extra tag may be added to accomplish this.
    - *qunyiśnjef mu vâurmotśarh* - 'I will fight you'
    - *qunyiśnjef mu tśarh vâurmo qâtśarh* - 'You, I will fight'

### Forms

The tag forms are given below.  Some tags have optional final vowels, used when the next suffix starts with a consonant (or when used alone for one-syllable tags), or optional final consonants, used when the next suffix starts with a vowel.  The pronunciation will include optional/elidable sounds.  Note that some tags are stressed while others are not.

Note that tags can be chained in order to make use of multiple ones.  Usually only the final tag is conjugated, although person suffixes can attach to earlier tags to mark topic if required.  For example, if asking for someone to speculate, one can use either 'eat SPC-he-it INT-you' or 'eat it SPC INT-you-him' to mean 'do you think he's eating it'.

## Aspect and Person Conjugation

[back to chapter top](#33-morphology---tags)

The tag forms above can take a number of agglutinative suffixes, these suffixes cause minimal changes to the base tag and do not take stress (although they can be stressed informally if too many unstressed syllables occur in a row).  Suffixes include aspect and person.

### Aspect suffixes

The exact meaning of aspect suffixes changes depending on whether the verb used is Perfective or Imperfective.  Aspect suffixes always appear before person suffixes; use of multiple aspect suffixes is allowed and common.  They may change form depending on front/back vowel of the attaching tag, while a glottal stop is inserted to break hiatuses between aspect suffixes and verb tags - optional vowel and optional stop are both dropped if they both exist, e.g. q(â) + (')anj > qanj.  Suffixes always appear the following order:

- lji/ljë
  - (not technically an aspect, but it fits in the suffix category)
  - Both verb roots >> **Causative (CAUS)** (make do, cause to do)
    - meħħonj mu qâ '(I) dig here' >> meħħonj mu qâljë '(I) make (someone/thing) dig here / cause...to dig'
    - meħħaonje mu qâ '(I am) digging here' >> meħħaonje mu qâljë '(I) make (something) be digging here / cause...to be digging'
- (')anj
  - Perfective >> **Habitual (HAB)** (sometimes/often do)
    - meħħonj mu qâ '(I) dig here' >> meħħonj mu qanj '(I) (sometimes/often) dig here'
  - Imperfective >> **Inchoative (INCH)** (start to do)
    - meħħaonje mu qâ '(I) am digging here' >> meħħaonje mu qanj '(I) start to dig here'
- fä
  - Perfective >> **Delimitative (DELIM)** (do a bit)
    - meħħonj mu qâ '(I) dig here' >> meħħonj mu qâfä '(I) dig here a bit'
  - Imperfective >> **Terminative (TERM)** (stop/finish doing)
    - meħħaonje mu qâ '(I) am digging here' >> meħħaonje mu qâfä '(I) stop/finish digging here'

### Person suffixes

Person suffixes on tags are optional, but usually used if the person doesn't correspond to the locative used (see section Locative Semantics in 3.2).  Up to 3 person suffixes can be used - two argument suffixes and one Vocative or Reference suffix.

- There are 3 distinct uses for person suffixes - Argument/Topic, Vocative and Tag Reference
  - **Argument suffixes** are used to reinforce or specify the arguments of a verb.  They use Nominative for the subject/agent and Accusative for the object/patient of the verb (even if the object itself is in another case).  If one of these arguments a Topic, then this one goes first; otherwise order is free.  By promoting the verb object to Topic position a passive-like construction can be formed.  The suffix marking the topic can be stressed or emphasised if required.
    - *qompëñ mu* >>
      - *... qâ* '(I/We) eat here' (IND)
      - *... qâghâ* 'We eat here' (IND-1p.NOM)
      - *... quyyêr* 'You eat it here' (IND-2s.NOM-3I.ACC)
      - *... ħaoñma quyyêr* 'You eat bread here' (IND-2s.NOM-3I.ACC)
      - *... ħaoñma qâyêru'* 'Bread is eaten here by you' (IND-3I.ACC-2s.NOM)
  - **Vocative suffixes** are used to address the sentence to someone.  They always use the Nominative form and always come last.  They are indistinguishable from nominative argument suffixes when placed last, though context is usually enough to clear it up.  A tag may include both a Nominative Argument *and* a Vocative suffix, in which case the final one is the vocative.  Vocative suffixes generally cannot be used with Reference suffixes.
    - *qompëñ mu qu'* 'You eat here' OR 'Hey you, (I/We) eat here'
    - *qompëñ mu qu'u'* 'Hey you, you eat here.'
  - **Tag reference/perspective suffixes** are used only with the SPC (Speculative) and COM (Commissive) tags.  They use the Nominative form, come first, and indicate the party whose view is expressed with those tags - in other words, *qâenjmo* 'SPC-1s.NOM' means 'I think'; *vâurqonj* 'COM-3Hs.NOM' means 's/he intends'.  This suffix generally *does not co-occur* with a Vocative suffix, but it *can* co-occur with Argument suffixes, including another nominative suffix.
    - *qompëñ mu qâenju'* '(I think) You might eat here' OR 'You think (I) might eat here'
    - *qompëñ mu qâenju'mo* 'You think I might eat here.'

Note that the final glottal stop of 2s.PRI *u'* assimilates to any following suffixes, e.g. *u' + fê* > *uffê*.

|Person| Nominative |IPA       | Accusative |IPA       |
|------|------------|----------|------------|----------|
| 1s   | mo         | /mɔ/     | fê         | /fe/     |

# 3.4: Morphology - Adjectives

This section will detail the morphology of adjectives in the language.

Like nouns, adjective inflections take the form of suffixes which do not alter the original word (except potentially the final consonant).  The suffix itself may be stressed if two syllables or more.

Sections (or [back to top](#chapters)):

- [Adjective Uses](#adjective-uses)
- [Derivation](#derivation-adjectives)

## Adjective Uses

[back to chapter top](#34-morphology---adjectives)

Adjectives can be used in 3 main ways:

- Attributively (on a noun or a pronoun)
  - *ħou aħak* - good house
  - *ħourä' u'* - *good you
- Predicatively (as a verb)
  - *aħak ħouqo* - the house being good
  - *aħak quħouqo* - the house not being good
  - *ħouqoñ mu aħak qâ* - my house is good
  - *ħouqoñof mu aħak qâ* - my house becomes good
- Nominalised (as a noun with that attribute)
  - *ħoute* - good thing (Inanimate Nominative)
    - *ħou, ħounôrh, ħouëx, ħouôra* (I-ACC/DAT/GEN/LOC)
  - *ħounjh* - good thing (Animate Nominative)
  - *ħounj* - good person (Human Nominative)
  - *ħougo* - good thing (Divine Nominative)

### Attributive Adjectives

When used attributively, adjectives go in front of the noun and must agree in Number with the noun.  When used on a pronoun, they must also agree in Person.  There is no adjective agreement in Noun Class or in Case.  1st person pronouns do not take specific person agreement endings, thus the 1st person pronoun forms are the same as noun agreement forms.  Note that the 3rd person Divine pronoun is considered to be Plural for the purposes of adjective agreement.

When adjectives take a Number suffix in front of a noun, it can be dropped from the noun; maintaining it serves to emphasise the number or countability.  When an adjective-noun phrase is modified by a quantifier/numeral or plural determiner, they may both drop number suffixes; maintaining a number suffix on either or both words emphasises number/countability following a determiner or quantifier, or indicates an inexact number following a numeral.

- *ħou uttum* - good fisher
- *ħouñënj uttum* - two good fishers
  - *ħouñënj uttuñqënj* - **two** good fishers
  - *quonj ħouñënj uttum/-ñqënj* - two or so two good fishers
- *ghâemqënj ħou uttum* - these two good fishers
  - *ghâemqënj ħouñënj uttum/-ñqënj* - these **two** good fishers
- *ħounox uttum* - good fishers
  - *ħounox uttunox* - good fishers **plural**
- *źü ħou uttum* - six good fishers
  - *źü ħounox uttum/-ndox* - six or so good fishers

Example words are: *ħou* 'good', *ete'* 'new', *uttum* 'netmaker/fisher'

### Pronominal Adjectives and Politeness

Because adjectives are required to agree with pronoun person and number, the pronoun itself can easily be dropped.  This is commonly used to replace pronouns in polite (formal and informal) speech with adjectives.  The adjective used can vary with situation, although certain adjectives are particularly commonplace.  The effect achieved is similar to English 'your/his/her ___', as in 'your excellency', 'her majesty'.

Adjectives don't take case suffixes, meaning that this usage is restricted to Nominative and Accusative case usage (with Accusative being marked by a corresponding pronoun suffix in the Tag).  

- Adjectives
  - 1st person
    - *pefśe* 'humble' is common when speaking politely to one's elders
    - *yaśta* 'friendly' is common when speaking politely to one's peers.
  - 2nd and 3rd person
    - *ħou* 'good' and *ħouźo* 'good-natured' are common to address/speak about others in all situations
    - *vae* 'foremost' and *aoa* 'senior' is commonly used for/towards one's elders
    - *yikkiś* 'magnificent' and *arralji'* 'mighty' are commonly used for/towards rulers and gods
  - such 'pronominal adjectives' can also be used to insult, as in *ârrôźyë* 'dull' or *ħâero* 'dirty'
- Politeness examples
  - *uir vâe (u') ħâunju'* - 'you should go there'
    - Polite: *uirâ vâe ħourä' ħâunju'* - lit. 'good (you) should go there'
  - *ienjaś minj (mvo) (tśarh) vâurmotśarh'* - 'I'll bring you over there'
    - Polite to elders: *ienjaś minj pefśe aoarä' vâurmotśarh* - lit. 'humble (I) will bring senior (you) over there'
    - Polite to peers: *ienjaś minj yaśta ħouźorä' vâurmotśarh* - lit. 'friendly (I) will bring good-natured (you) over there'
- Irreverant: *jêñghanjh minj (qâuñ) qâqon* - '(the king) he sees it/over there'
  - Reverent: *jêñghanjh minj yikkiś'arh qâqon* - lit. 'magnificent (him) sees it/over there'

Such polite speech is common among strangers and acquaintances, towards customers/patrons or from people of a lower status to those of a higher one (generation/age, work, etc).

During the reign of the Central Kingdom, case suffixes were allowed to attach to pronominal adjectives, extending to system to replace the entire original pronoun system in polite speech.  This innovation was generally restricted to people within the Kingdom however.

### Predicate Adjectives

Adjectives can be used predicatively by converting them into verbs using the suffix -qo, which derives from the verb qâe (to be / to become).  In this form, they can be used either as participles or as im/perfective verbs in all uses.  Note that this suffix can be used for other parts of speech as well.

Note that there is a distinction between using an adjective and using its predicate participle attributively, i.e. between *ħounox uttum* 'the good fishers' and *quħouqonox uttum* 'the being-good fishers'.  The distinction is similar to the essence-vs-state distinction of Iberian languages - that is, *ħounox uttum* describes fishers who are, by their nature/essence, good, while *quħouqonox uttum* describes fishers who are currently being, or considered right now to be, good.

The construction of all 4 verb stems of the predicate adjective is regular.  Predicate adjectives do not need to agree with a noun when used as a verb, but when a participle is used attributively (uncommon, as explained above), it will take agreement suffixes after the verb suffix.  The suffix introduces a secondary stress to a previous syllable if that syllable doesn't already have stress.

|Form|English           |Affix   |Example A |IPA         |Example B  |IPA          |

- IMPF: _**ħouqoñ** mu aħak qâ_ - 'my house is good'
- PERF: _**ħouqoñof** mu aħak qâ_ - 'my house becoming good'

### Nominalised Adjectives

Adjectives can be used to represent things with that attribute when *nominalised*.  In order to do this, the adjective takes the appropriate noun class ending.

|Class/Case|English           |Affix       |Example A |IPA         |Example B  |IPA          |
|-----     |------------------|------------|----------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| INAN.NOM |good/new thing    | -te/to     | ħouto    |/ˈħou̯tɔ/    | etette    |/ˈɛtɛttɛ/    |
| ANIM.NOM |good/new thing    | -(e/o)njh  | ħounjh   |/ˈħou̯ɲ̊/     | ete'enjh  |/ˈɛtɛʔɛɲ̊/    |
| HUMN.NOM |good/new person   | -(o)nj     | ħounj    |/ˈħou̯ɲ/     | ete'onj   |/ˈɛtɛʔɔɲ/    |
| DIVN.NOM |good/new thing    | -ge/ko/etc | ħougo    |/ˈħou̯gɔ/    | etekke    |/ˈɛtɛkkɛ/    |

These can be used the same as any noun.  They tend to take indefinite meanings, contrasting with pronominalised adjectives which must take definite meanings -- compare *ħouto* 'a good thing / something good' vs *ħou'arh (qâħ)* 'the good thing' (lit. good \[it])

### Inflection Notes

- Fist person/Noun dual and plural endings (beginning in a nasal) combine with an adjective's final nasal or glottal stop to produce a nasal-stop cluster
  - ete' + -njex > etencex 'new (plural)'
  - ârrhâem + -ñënj > ârrhâeñqënj 'high (you & I)'
  - Note that this only occurs with adjective inflections, not with nasal suffixes generally
    - ete' + -njix > etennjix 'new thing (animate genitive)'
    - ârrhâem + -ñah > ârrhâemñah 'new thing (animate/human locative)'
- Second person endings (beginning in an R) combine with an adjective's final rhotic or glottal stop to produce a geminated rhotic
  - ete' + -rä' > eterrä' 'new (you)'
  - njarh + -räccex > njarräccex 'narrow (you\.pl)'

## Derivation (Adjectives)

[back to chapter top](#34-morphology---adjectives)

Adjectives can be derived in many regular ways from existing words.

### Comparison and Negation

Comparison and Negation are done through unstressed affixes that come before the word

|Meaning    |English           |Prefix      |Example A |IPA         |Example B  |IPA          |
|-----      |------------------|------------|----------|------------|-----------|-------------|
|Comparative|better / newer    | caf-       | cafħou   |/cæfˈħou̯/   | cafete'   |/cæˈfɛtɛʔ/   |
|Superlative|best / newest     | mef-       | mefħou   |/mɛfˈħou̯/   | mefete'   |/mɛˈfɛtɛʔ/   |
|Negative   |not good/new      | qui-       | quiħou   |/ɢuɪ̯ˈħou̯/   | quiete'   |/ɢuɪ̯ˈɛtɛʔ/   |
|Neg.Compar |less good/new     | mui-       | muiħou   |/muɪ̯ˈħou̯/   | muiete'   |/muɪ̯ˈɛtɛʔ/   |
|Neg.Super  |least good/new    | mea-       | meaħou   |/meɐ̯ˈħou̯/   | meaete'   |/meɐ̯ˈɛtɛʔ/   |

### Deriving Adjectives

There are a number of adjectives formed using Vuhîñkam sources of regular adjective derivation, but none of these are productive due to complex sound changes (though they tend to end in open-mid vowels).

New adjectives are commonly derived through prefixes which evolved from Vuhîñkam prepositions.

- *quttampa'* /ˈɢutˌtæm̥pæʔ/ 'rope' > *quttampâeo* /ˈɢuttæm̥ˌpɑe̯ɔ/ 'made of rope' through a Vuhîñkam suffix
- *źñärhä* /ˈʑɴar̥a/ 'metal' > irźñärhä /irˈʑɴar̥a/ 'metallic, forged from metal' through an Uħħuonanjh prefix

# 3.5: Morphology - Adverbs

This section will detail the morphology of adverbs in the language.

Adverbs, along with verbs, shed much of their inflection which was instead attached to the sentence-final Tag particle.  They retain only the Imperfective vs Perfective, but unlike verbs this is a regular inflection with very few irregular forms.

Sections (or [back to top](#chapters)):

- [Adverb Usage and Agreement](#adverb-usage-and-agreement)
- [Derivation](#derivation-adverbs)
- [Examples](#adverb-examples)

## Adverb Usage and Agreement

[back to chapter top](#35-morphology---adverbs)

Adverbs can be used to modify either verbs, other adjectives / adverbs or apply to entire clauses / sentences.  When modifying a verb or a phrase with a verb (not including participles) they agree with the verb's aspect.  When modifying a verb or an adjective / adverb, they appear *before* the modified word (including between a tag and verb in a subordinate clause), whereas when modifying a clause or sentence they can appear anywhere within it, but by default will appear before the final 'head' - usually the sentence-final Tag or the participle head of a relative clause.  

The imperfective and perfective suffixes *can* also be used when the adverb is modifying participles or clauses headed by participles, and it is common to use a dummy adverb (commonly *ħeffa* 'well') to mark this when a participle represents a verb with quite different imperfective and perfective meanings, if the meaning is not evident from context or needs particular emphasis.  It can also be used to clarify the aspect when tag aspect suffixes are used in relative clauses (since HAB-INCH and DELIM-TERM can be quite different).

While the use of a specific intensifier adverb such as *meccafa heffa/ñêra* 'very well/round' does happen when modifying adjectives and adverbs, it is also common to simply duplicate the adverb (if modifying an adverb) or duplicate the adjective and turn it into an adverb - *heffa heffa* 'very well', lit. 'well well' and *ñêrafa ñêra* 'very round', lit. 'roundly round'.

### Agreement and Inflection

Example words are: *ħeffa* 'well', *xam* 'up(wards)', *uirâ - uir - uirñe* 'to go (PART - PERF - IMPF)'

|Form   |Affix   |Example A     |IPA         |Example B    |IPA          |
|----   |--------|--------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
|neutral| -      | ħeffa uirâ   |/ˈħɛffæ/    | xam uirâ    |/ˈxæm/       |
|PERF   | -(a/â)f| ħeffaf uir   |/ˈħɛffæf/   | xamaf uir   |/ˈxæmæf/     |
|IMPF   | -(a/â)ñ| ħeffañ uirñe |/ˈħɛffæɴ/   | xamañ uirñe |/ˈxæmæɴ/     |

## Derivation (Adverbs)

[back to chapter top](#35-morphology---adverbs)

An unstressed version of the inherited suffix is still productive in Uħħuonanjh, this suffix is used to derive adverbs from adjectives - including participles acting as adjectives, which is commonly used to express 'while doing X'.  Many common adverbs are ultimately derived from the stressed version of this suffix, but this stressed version is no longer productive.

- Stressed version
  - *ħou* 'good' > *ħeffa* 'well'
  - *vif* 'full' > *vieffa* 'fully / completely'
  - *pumfë* 'correct'
    - *pumfa* 'correctly (common)'
    - *pumfofa* /ˈpum̥ˌfɔfæ/ 'correctly (formal)'
  - *njarh* 'narrow'
    - *njarfa* 'narrowly / just  (common)'
    - *njarrhäfa* /ˈɲær̥ˌr̥afæ/ 'narrowly / just  (formal)'
- Unstressed version: -fa/-va after a voiced final consonant
  - *pefśe* 'humble' > *pefśefa* /ˈpɛfɕɛfæ/ 'humbly'
  - *yikkiś* 'magnificent' > *yikkiśfa* /ˈɟikkiɕfæ/ 'magnificently'
  - *gheħħemh* 'proud' > *gheħħemhfa* /ˈɣɛħħɛm̥fæ/ 'proudly'
  - *qompëñ* 'eating' > *qompëñva* /ˈɢɔm̥pɤɴʋæ/ 'while eating' (lit. 'eatingly')

## Adverb Examples

[back to chapter top](#35-morphology---adverbs)

- *ħeffa qomë varħaccin* 'the hunter who lives/survives well'
  - *ħeffaf qomë varħaccin* 'the hunter who survives well'

# 4.1: Sentence Structure

This section will go through methods of constructing proper sentences in Uħħuonanjh.

Sections (or [back to top](#chapters)):

- [Word Order](#word-order)
- [Topic Prominence](#topic-prominence)
- [Copular Constructions](#copular-constructions)
- [Conjunctions and Coordinate Clauses](#conjunctions-and-coordinate-clauses)
- [Content Clauses](#content-clauses)

## Word Order

[back to chapter top](#41-sentence-structure)

Word order in main clauses is (Topic)-Verb-Noun Phrases-Locative-Tag; adverbial noun phrases tend to come after verb arguments but this is not a strict rule.  Word order of these intervening elements is not strict as nouns are marked for case, though the first element tends to be the topic.  A minimal sentence consists of a Verb and a Tag, although while the Locative Pronoun is not required grammatically, it is almost always present, at least in the first sentence of a dialogue or communication.

Word order in dependent clauses is Noun Phrases-(Locative)-(Topic)-(Tag)-Verb; note that unlike the main clause, Tags and Locatives are optional and commonly dropped.

## Topic Prominence

[back to chapter top](#41-sentence-structure)

Uħħuonanjh is a Topic-Prominent language, tending to place the sentence Topic directly before the verb.  Other noun phrases can appear in any order as long as they are between the Verb/Locative pronoun and the Sentence-final Tag of a main clause, or before the verb (and after a comma) of a dependent clause.

Topic prominence is also expressed through the conjugation of sentence-final tags, where arguments are usually placed topic-first.

|English                                |Uħħuonanjh                                   |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
|I brought a pear home for you (formal) |ienjaś mu urumva camħencêrh tśarêrh qârh     |
|I brought a pear home for you (common) |ienjaś mu urumva camħencêrh tśarêrh qârhmoyêr|
|Me, I brought a pear home for you      |mvo ienjaś mu urumva camħencêrh tśarêrh qârhmoyêr|
|The pear I brought it home for you     |urumva ienjaś mu camħencêrh tśarêrh qârhyêrmo|
|Home, I brought the pear for you       |camħencêrh ienjaś mu urumva tśarêrh qârhyêrmo|
|For you, I brought the pear home       |tśarêrh ienjaś mu urumva camħencêrh qârhtśarhmo|

## Copular Constructions

[back to chapter top](#41-sentence-structure)

The copula is expressed with the imperfective verb *qâeñ* (*qâe, jêño* participles).  When equating two noun phrases, both are used in the Nominative case.

The copula is not used as a separate verb for adjectives.  Instead, it is suffixed to the adjective (as *-qoñ*) to convert the adjective into a verb meaning 'to be X'.

## Conjunctions and Coordinate Clauses

[back to chapter top](#41-sentence-structure)

Conjunctions such as *ħuom* 'and' can link sentences, coming between them with slight pauses before and after (expressed in writing with a comma before and after).

Conjunctions include:

- *ħuom* 'and' - used both as a conjunction and to link noun phrases
- *vorhâr* 'or' - used both as a conjunction and to link all kinds of phrases (noun, verb or descriptor)
- *rhu* 'if' - generally restricted to formal use as its function has largely been replaced by the Conditional Mood
- *verh* 'because'
- *fezzo* 'so, then'

Sentences can also simply link to each other with no conjunction in between, with the relationship determined either by the mood of each sentence (especially Conditional mood) or by the logic between the two sentences.

e.g. 'I sit and you eat', while it could be rendered as 'I sit, *huom*, you eat', would more commonly simply be rendered as 'I sit, you eat'.  Same for 'he saw us so he knows', which could more commonly be 'he saw us, he knows' rather than explicitly using the conjunction *fezzo*.

The usual alternative to using words like 'because', 'so', 'when', etc to form adverbial clauses, when the relationship between these sentences is necessary to explain, is to use a noun phrase instead - 'he saw us so he knows' becomes 'from him seeing us, he knows', with the noun phrase placed in topic position if required.  In cases where the phrase would be too long, or in cases where a full sentence is desired, they may be placed in separate main clauses, with the first clause referred to in the topic of the second using the pronoun *aoś* 'this' - 'he saw that we had arrived home, so he knows' becomes 'he saw that we had arrived home, from this, he knows.'

## Content Clauses

[back to chapter top](#41-sentence-structure)

Content clauses are often linked to the sentence where they are referenced simply by placing them in sequence, in the same way as coordinate clauses above.  For example, 'he said "I want to go" when he saw me' becomes 'he said when he saw me, "I want to go"'.  There is no need to refer to the content clause in the main clause, although it can be done - most speech verbs allow the words expressed as an accusative verb argument.

# 4.2: Noun Phrases

This section will detail noun phrases.  In particular, it will take a look at the many uses of the different cases and go through postpositional constructions and their use in replacing adverbial clauses.

While the use of noun phrases as verb arguments and adverbials is often distinct, there is not a lot of strict differentiation between them.  It is common to place verb arguments before adverbials, but it is not grammatically required and it is also common to place an adverbial first when it's the topic.  Only verb arguments are usually allowed to take Tag person suffixes, which allows some differentiation.

Sections (or [back to top](#chapters)):

- [Verb Argument Use of Cases](#verb-argument-use-of-cases)
- [Adverbial Use of Cases](#adverbial-use-of-cases)
- [Postpositional Phrases](#postpositional-phrases)

## Verb Argument Use of Cases

[back to chapter top](#42-noun-phrases)

Verbs aren't marked for transitivity or valency; each verb has a number of common arguments and all, or none, of these may be used at once with the sentence still being grammatically correct.  When an argument is omitted, it is either assumed to refer to an indefinite argument or a specific one if mentioned in context (including the context of the locative pronoun as well as pragmatic context).

When multiple arguments are present of the same case, it is simply assumed that they all take part in the action in the same role, e.g. 'Mary John run' == 'Mary and John run'.  A conjunction would only be used to join these noun phrases for emphasis.  The exception here is with the copula, where two or more Nominative arguments are equated - the common workaround is to place one side as a Topic, then use a plural pronoun to refer to all of them in the copular sentence itself, as in 'Mary John, they are doctors'.

- *verxanjh* 'to rain' - usually takes 0 arguments
  - *verxanjh mu qâ* - Is raining here
    - Standard usage, equivalent to 'It is raining (here)'
  - *verxanjh mu qâmoyêr* - I rain it here
    - Unusual usage, perhaps using 'rain' metaphorically, e.g. in the sense 'spread widely'
- *xea* 'to exist' - usually takes 1 argument (NOM)
  - *xeañ quo qâ* - exists somewhere
    - Unusual usage without context, equivalent to 'something exists somewhere'
    - Not unusual usage with context, equivalent to '(X,) it exists somewhere'
  - *xeañ mu qâ* - exists here
    - Common usage for when the thing that exists is known/obvious or irrelevant
    - Also common usage without context, where the locative 'mu' suggests a first person subject
  - *xeañ mu qâmo* - I exist here
    - Standard usage
  - *xeañ mu mvo muqqaśte urumvate qâ(ghâ)* - Me, a peach and a pear exist here
    - Standard usage
  - *xeañ mu qâmoyêr* - I exist it here
    - Unusual usage.  Use of additional ACC argument implies that 'it' has been changed/affected by my existence here.
- *ljêra'* 'to pull' - usually takes 2 arguments (NOM and ACC)
  - *ljêra' quo qâ* - pulls somewhere
    - Unusual usage, equiv. to 'pulling is happening somwhere'
  - *ljêra' mu qâ* - pulls here; *ljêra' mu qâmo* - I pull here
    - These two are usually equivalent outside of context
    - Common usage where the object is known/obvious or irrelevant
  - *ljêra' mu qâmoyêr* - I pull it here
    - Standard usage
  - *ljêra' mu yerêrh qâmo* - I pull to it here
    - Not unusual usage where the object is not considered to have changed/been affected by the action
      - e.g. 'I pulled the rock but it didn't budge', 'the rock' would be DAT instead of ACC to mark that it hasn't changed state/been affected
- *vaħħoñ* 'to say/tell' - takes up to 3-4 arguments (NOM, ACC/GEN, DAT)
  - *vaħħoñ quo qâ* - Someone somewhere talks
  - *vaħħoñ mu qâ(mo)* - (I) talk here
  - *vaħħoñ mu qâmoyêr* - I say it here
  - *vaħħoñ mu yerix qâmo* - I talk about it here
  - *vaħħoñ mu tśarêrh qâmoyêr* - I tell you it here
  - *vaħħoñ mu tśarêrh yerix qâmo* - I talk to you about it here
  - *vaħħoñ mu yêr tśarêrh yerix qâmo* - I say it to you about him/her here

## Adverbial Use of Cases

[back to chapter top](#42-noun-phrases)

Nouns inflected in DAT/GEN/LOC cases are commonly used as simple adverbials.

Nouns in NOM or ACC case can be placed before the verb as a disjoint Topic (one that doesn't play any explicit role in the sentence other than to set the context).  It is common to place inanimate topics in ACC and all other topics in NOM, though this can be inverted to place an emphasis on the agency of an inanimate noun or the non-agency of others.

Adverbials can be suffixed with -qo/ñ/of to turn into a verb 'to be X', in the same way as adjectives, e.g. *ħuoñdvaśêra* 'in the forest' > *ħuoñdvaśêraqo* 'to be in the forest'.  (The use of this suffix for verb arguments is rarer and tends to be restricted to informal speech)

Some examples of simple adverbials:

- DAT
  - to / towards
  - for / for X's sake
  - onto/into/out to/over to/etc X
  - in order to X
  - until X / up to X / before X
  - similar to X
- GEN
  - of X / X's
  - from X / away from X / off X
  - against X
  - from X onwards / starting from X / after X
  - about X / regarding X
  - because of X
  - around X
- LOC
  - at/in/on X, on top of X
  - along with X / along X
  - INS (instrumental-specific uses)
    - with/by/using/through/via X
    - in the manner of X

### Possessives

While Genitive case is the most commonly used for possession, it's not the only way to express the relationship, and is usually only used when the possessor has is a greater or equal party in the relaionship.  When the possessor is commonly seen as a lesser party, it is common to use Dative instead.  If the relationship could be described better as Locative, then that is used.  The decision of which case to use is a purely semantic choice, all choices are equally correct grammatically.

- The person's dog - xaśonjëx fimtśanjh - person.GEN dog
- The dog's owner - fimtśancêrh ħakkeuöm - dog.DAT person
- the person's family - xaśonenj fesqampaonyex - person.DAT family
- the person's family (descendants) - xaśonjëx fesqampaonyex - person.GEN family
- The island's forest - üâeñaħ ħuoñdvaś - island.LOC forest

## Postpositional Phrases

[back to chapter top](#42-noun-phrases)

Postpositions are a special type of noun, often used to form noun phrases analogous to English prepositional noun phrases.  They give more specific information of the relationship/direction/movement of nouns than cases.  While normal nouns can be used in a similar manner to form noun phrases, postpositions are unique in that they maintain a distinction between Locative case (LOC) ending in -ñah and Instrumentative (INS) case ending in -êra/-ôra.

When using postpositions, the original noun is inflected in a case to relate it to the postposition (commonly GEN), while the postposition is now considered the head of the phrase and inflected for the relationship to the clause as a whole (e.g. 'on top of the table' > table.GEN top.LOC).  The postposition can also be used as a normal noun, simply referring to some part, space or relation to the modified noun (e.g. *the inside* of the house, *the top/surface* of the table)

Common postpositions are listed in the following tables.  If not specified, the modified noun will be in GEN case.  Postpositions can generally take any relevant case, not just the ones listed. As an example, *fśeaz* 'front of' can be used in any case - NOM (the front of the box is yellow), ACC (they hit the front of the box), DAT (they walk in front of me \[and stays there]), GEN (they walk from in front of me), LOC (they are in front of me) and INS (they pass by in front of me \[and are no longer there]).

Note that postpositions commonly abbreviate Dative case endings to -njêrh (with the nasal assimilating stem-final nasals) - this is common informally for many inanimate words, but also common in normal language in postpositions.

- vaś and xacca are synonymous, deriving from 'sky' and 'mountain' respectively.  Some communities favour one or the other, others use both equally.
- while 'above' and 'on top of' have separate postpositions, the opposite 'below' and 'right underneath / on the bottom of' share the same word.  'Mekkenjêrh' can have locative meanings (we sit below/under/beneath the stars), despite itself being in dative case.  'Mekkeñah' can similarly have dative meanings (we attach it to the bottom of the box).

### Note on translating adverbial clauses

Adverbial clauses do not occur in the language, instead they tend to be replaced by relative clauses or noun phrases (often headed by a postposition).

- X when Y > X during Y.noun
  - I saw the king when I got home
    - 'I saw the king at arriving home'
    - see DST king.DAT, home-DAT arriving-LOC, IND.PAST-1s.NOM
    - jêñghaf minj vakkênênj, camħencêrh xaśanjêra, qârhmoyênj
  - I saw the king after I got home
    - 'I saw the king at **end of** arriving home'
    - see DST king.ACC, my home-DAT arriving-GEN **end-LOC**, IND.PAST-1s.NOM
    - jêñghaf minj vakkênênj, camħencêrh xaśanjix **färhñaħ**, qârhmoyênj
- X, because Y / X, for Y > X with cause Y.noun
  - You can't stay, because she is tired
    - 'You can't stay, from cause of her being tired'
      - stay PRX.NEG her being.tired-GEN cause-GEN PRH-2s.VOC
    - You can't stay because that: she is tired
      - stay PRX.NEG that-GEN cause-GEN PRH-2s.VOC: be.tired IND-2s.NOM

*TODO: add more examples of these?  or maybe leave them to semantics?*

# 4.3: Verb Phrases

This section will detail verb phrases.  In particular, it will give a short summary on independnent clause verb phrases (this topic is mostly covered already in the Verb/Tag morphology sections), then it will go into detail regarding verb-headed relative clauses.

Sections (or [back to top](#chapters)):

- [Summary of Verb Syntax](#summary-of-verb-syntax-so-far)
- [Serial Verb Constructions](#serial-verb-constructions)
- [Participles and Relative Clauses](#participles-and-relative-clauses)

## Summary of Verb Syntax so far

[back to chapter top](#43-verb-phrases)

Each verb has 4 roots, PART, PART.NEG, PERF and IMPF; these roots are invariant (except for deriving new words).  Verbs are often accompanied by a Locative Pronoun, which also provides the verb with negative and emphatic markers.  Verbs always come first in a sentence / main clause.

In order to be able to use a verb in a sentence, it requires a sentence-final Tag.  This Tag conjugates for Mood, Tense, Aspect (within the bounds of the verb's Perfective or Imperfective aspect) and Person.

Multiple tags can be used in a single sentence, combining the meanings of all used tags (though in practice the number of tags used rarely exceeds 2, almost never above 3)

## Serial Verb Constructions

[back to chapter top](#43-verb-phrases)

Multiple verbs can be chained wherever they are used.  The resulting meaning is either that of 'X and Y' or 'X then/to/until Y', although this is determined pragmatically and not grammatically.  Each verb can take its own locative pronoun or one locative pronoun located after the final verb can apply to all verbs in the chain.  Verbs don't have to agree on PERF/IMPF, and if they disagree then only the final one is taken into account when applying aspects.

For the second meaning 'X until Y', it is common to use an adjective + verb ending -qoñ.

|Uħħuonanjh|Gloss|English|
|----------|-----|-------|
|Mâenjârâ mu quljârâ vâe qanjqonj|come.PERF PRX go.PERF MED IND-HAB-3Hs.NOM|S/he (sometimes) comes (here) and goes (there)|
|Qompuo quttśee mu qâghâ|eat.IMPF drink.IMPF PRX IND-1p.NOM|We are eating and drinking|
|Mâenjârâ qompëñ mu śancu'!|come.PERF eat.PERF mu IMP.POL-2s.NOM|(You,) come (here) and eat here!|
|Varħanjef qompëñ minj qanjqonj|hunt.PERF eat.PERF DST IND-HAB-3Hs.NOM|S/he hunts and eats OR S/he hunts to eat|
|Vâeoñqof paomvaqoñ mu qârfê|shock.PERF white-be.IMPF PRX IND.PAST-1s.ACC|I was shocked (until I was) pale/white in the face|
|Qompëñ vifqoñ minj qârhqonj|eat.PERF full-be.IMPF DST IND.PAST-3s.NOM|He ate until he was full|

## Participles and Relative Clauses

[back to chapter top](#43-verb-phrases)

Verb participles have two primary functions: they can either act as an Inanimate noun (representing the action), inflecting for case and taking a place in the sentence as a noun phrase, or they can act as an adjective (attributive - modifying nouns, predicative - X is adj or nominalised - those who are X).  In both cases, the participle can also act as the head of its own relative clause, taking its own noun phrases.

Note that a participle used as an Inanimate noun representing the action does *not* require the Nominative -te/-to ending.  A nominalised participle still requires it.

### Bare participle use examples

Some examples of participle use.  Anywhere that a participle can be used, a relative clause can be used as well.

- *gheanjh* 'sitting / to sit'
  - *arralnjin mu gheanjenjêrh qâ* 'I love sitting' (noun)
  - *gheanjenj ko'amponj* 'the sitting man / the man who is sitting' (attributive adjective)
- *qunljar* 'fighting / to fight'
  - *jêñghanjef minj qunljarix qâmo* 'I look away from the fighting' (noun)
  - *qunljarñênj ghomoñqaħ* 'with/at/by the fighting women' (attributive adjective)
  - *qunljarrä' u'* 'you, who is fighting' (attributive adjective on pronoun)
  - *qunljarte* 'fighting thing' (adjective nominalised as Inanimate.Nominative)
  - *qunljarqoñ* 'to be fighting' (predicative adjective)

### Relative clause construction

Relative clauses word order is simply Verb-final, with free word order otherwise.  When used in a sentence, relative clauses are usually surrounded by pauses (commas in romanisation) in order to separate the main clause arguments from the relative clause ones.

In relative clauses, the participle acts as a verb and thus allows nouns to take nominative and accusative cases as required.  If the participle modifies a noun, then that noun is considered to be the subject of the verb unless otherwise specified.

Relative clauses may contain a Tag, placed in directly *before* the verb in this case, but the tag is not mandatory.  The locative pronoun is similarly not necessary unless required for negation or emphasis.

- me'ekkeñaħ gheanjh
  - `ground-LOC sit.PART`
  - sitting on the ground
- arralnjin quo, me'ekkeñaħ gheanjenjêrh, qâmo

# 4.4: Derivational Affixes

This section will list common affixes used to derive new words.

Sections (or [back to top](#chapters)):

- [Prefixes Derived From Prepositions](#prefixes-derived-from-prepositions)
- [Other Derivation](#other-derivation)

## Prefixes Derived From Prepositions

[back to chapter top](#44-derivational-affixes)

While prepositions have fallen out of use themselves, they have been commonly used to form new words when prefixed.

These affixes don't take or alter stress when creating new words, however many words were created using these prefixes *before* sound changes, thus allowing them to influence the word stem.

# 5.5: Verb and Adverb Reference

This section relists all Verb stem, Adverbs and Locative pronoun inflection paradigms

Sections (or [back to top](#chapters)):

- [Verb Stems](#verb-stems)
- [Participles](#participle-inflections)
- [Locative Pronouns](#locative-pronoun-inflections)
- [Adverbs](#adverb-inflections)

## Verb Stems

[back to chapter top](#55-verb-and-adverb-reference)

Most verbs have irregular stems, the below regular stems apply only to newly coined verbs.  None of the affixes change stress

|PART       |PART-NEG   |PERF       |IMPF|
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| -         |qu-        |-(e/o)f    |-o/e        |

|qâuga      |quqâuga    |qâugaf     |qâugao      |

## Participle Inflections

[back to chapter top](#55-verb-and-adverb-reference)

Participles, when used attributively for a relative clause, inflect a bit differently to other inanimate nouns.  They inflect for the case that the modified noun would take in the introduced relative clause.  When modifying an Inanimate Noun that would take the -êra ending in LOC, the participle takes that instead.

|case|ending              | example   |
|----|------------        |-----------|
|NOM |-te, -to (optional) | uirâ(to)  |
|ACC |-keu, -kou          | uirâkou   |
|DAT |-(e)njêrh, -(o)nôrh | uirânôrh  |
|GEN | -ix, -ëx           | uirâëx    |

## Agriculture

[back to chapter top](#6-culture)

Crop farming had already been developed during the later Vuhinkam (Neolithic) era, especially around the river valley.  Techniques were further developed and new crops were domesticated during the Uħħuononj (Bronze/Iron) era, with agriculture spreading throughout Uħħuononj lands.  Animal domestication happened throughout the Vuhinkam era, and by the Uħħuononj era certain livestock had become commonplace.

  - **Tin** - *totfrhä*
    - used in the mid-late Vuhinkam era, difficult to process.
    - The development of the Bellows *uovdvë* allowed Smelting *rheük* to begin
  - **Copper** - *to'rhä*
    - used in the late Vuhinkam era (Chalcolithic), but difficult to process.
    - The development of the Furnace *rhekkê* allowed easier smelting and copper was commonly used in tools and weapons
    - Copper was rare however, mostly found in the north, encouraging settlement along the north coast
  - **Bronze** - *qundoarä*
    - the discovery and use of Bronze marks the beginning of the Bronze age, occurring around the same time as the Shech. migrations
    - the smelting industry was concentrated in the lower river valley
    - tools and weapons made with bronze allowed the towns of the lower river to flourish and dominate
    - Casting *erraonja'* using Casts *orrâeë* was developed as a way to mass produce bronze items
  - **Iron** - *miśrhä*
    - (meteoric) iron was used in the Copper/Bronze eras, valued for its toughness but incredibly rare and difficult to work with.  It was called *vaśrhä*, considered a gift from the sky
    - as smelting technologies improved, eventually Iron could be smelted successfully.  Iron was rare in the lower river valley, but common in the upper river valley (as well as the northlands and south coast).  Ironworking was first developed in upper river valley kingdoms after the Great Floods, and was what propelled the Central Kingdom to dominance.

## Knowledge and Mythology

[back to chapter top](#6-culture)

The Pantheon of Gods was based on stories passed down through elders and solidified into a common set of deities which were respected, though not necessarily worshipped, by the end of the Vuhinkam era.  After the Migration, those that were left explained their ties to the land as worship of their ancestors, in the belief it would grant them powers and a better life.  These two concepts form the core of the Uħħuononj Mythology.

### Pantheon of Gods - *Ghâudokko*

The Pantheon of Gods was not codified until the start of the Lower River Kingdoms, where each kingdom had their own version of the pantheon; these were united into one official Pantheon in the Central Kingdom.  However, none of these entities worshipped the deities directly - there was no expectation that the deities themselves would pay any attention to mere humans.  This was resolved in two ways.

The first, which spread from the lower kingdoms and eventually dominated most of the Uħħuononj lands, held that each person's Ancestors were responsible for either liaising with the gods, or were granted powers over these gods' domains.  Thus, rather than worshipping the gods, it was more useful to worship one's ancestors, in order for them to intercede on behalf of the person and grant divine favour (or protect them from divine wrath).

The second, which was developed in the upper hills and spread throughout the highlands, maintained that through communual dedication to one deity in particular, the gods could be reached.  Thus, many highlands communities nominate a Patron Deity and worship them.  While the Cult of Ancestors still exists, it plays somewhat less of a role, especially in the mountains.

The Pantheon listed below is the form codified in the Central Kingdom (thus other variations can exist in other regions).  It is organised into 4 Pairs and 1 Triad.

- **Vaśnjoqquoggo** - The Pair of the Sky
  - **Ienjaoge** - God of the Night / Winter
  - **Yinddźaoge** - Goddess of the Day / Non-winter seasons
- **Tośquoggo** - The Pair of the Change
  - **Tfencikke** - Goddess of the Winds/Weather
  - **Qu'ħusko** - God of the Seasons/Harvests
- **Camħeqquoggo** - The Pair of the Constancy
  - **Xaqqêkke** - God of the Earth/Mountains
  - **Me'rheazge** - God of the Seas
- **Uħħuquoggo** - The Pair of Humanity/Human Worlds
  - **Vaoñdvikke** - Goddess of Travels/Knowledge/The Living World
  - **Ljaearmikke** - Goddess of the Dead/Ancestors/The Spirit World
- **Esakkxikke** - The Triad of Cycles
  - **Ljiħħeimge** - Goddess of Creation/Birth
  - **Qunljarge** - God of Destruction/War
  - **Jêñghakke** - The Watcher/The Balancer/The Judge/The Eye

### Cult of Ancestors

Most communities of Uħħuononj were part of a Cult of Ancestors.  However, the exact naure of the belief could be quite different.

For most early bronze age communities, it was common to worship a local pantheon of community ancestors, commonly past leaders and important people.  Each community had their own ancestral pantheon (Ljakke).

In the south and river valley region, where many large family communities existed, the community pantheon would wholly consist of one's own personal ancestors (Qamke), and during the Lower Kingdoms period, the concept was extended such that each person would worship their own specific pantheon of ancestors based on the relationships and deeds of their ancestors.  The mass emigrations during the Great Flood and subsequent Unification of the Central Kingdom caused these beliefs to spread to most northern communities as well.

In the upper river region instead, when other families were integrated into a community, they were inducted into the family.  With the development of larger towns, new residents were encouraged or forced to convert to the pantheon of the local ruler in order to maintain authority.  When Kingdoms formed in the upper river, the king's Royal Pantheon would be worshipped throughout the territory by everyone.

As a result of these different tendencies, the Lower Kingdoms tended to continue the tribal tradition of Elected Kings, while the Upper Kingdoms had a system of Hereditary Monarchy.

### Calendar

Sky observations among the Uħħuononj are rather minimal (astronomy was introduced to the Uħħuononj in the Iron Age from the southern Shechageghern people).  However, natural observations (animal migrations, plant reactions, rains, etc) are common, and along with the tendency of the river to flood after Melts, a solar calendar is devised.

- Seasons of the Year - *qu'ħuśśaix esa* or *qu'ħuśśaëx esa*
  - **Winter** - *Iske* - season of Night - long nights and a period of rest
  - **Spring** - *Rhüźakke* - season of the Melt - when snow falling in the Mountain Springs region (*Jêiśħeimonj*) melts and brings floods, along with increased fertility, downriver.  The First Melt is an important annual celebration.
  - **Summer** - *Kusko* - season of Plenty - where fruits and berries begin to ripen and early harvests bring plenty of food to the table.
  - **Autumn** - *Ħusko* - season of Harvest - where the main annual crops are harvested and communities chip in to help harvest and prepare for winter.  The First Harvest and Final Harvest are important annual celebrations.

### Weather

The weather, domain of the deity *Tfencikke*, is controlled by her child and 5 grandchildren, birds which reside in different environments bringing these conditions to the land.  They are:

- **Vaśnjaontśko** - the Mother Bird, residing in the sky and calming her children, thus calming the weather/winds
- **Vônjoutśko** - the Frost Bird, residing in the frozen Northlands, bringing cold, dry winds when agitated
- **Ħanjmitśko** - the Flame Bird, residing in the scorching Cursed Desert, bringing hot, dry winds when agitated
- **Verxotśko** - the Rain Bird, residing in the northwestern seas, periodically bringing cool, wet winds
- **Pâenjattśko** - the Storm Bird, residing in the southwestern seas, bringing strong winds and storms when agitated
- **Ghâeñoyattśko** - the Mountain Bird, residing in the eastern mountains, never getting agitated

## Worship and Festivity

[back to chapter top](#6-culture)

Each community worships the gods and their ancestors differently, however there are some common/widespread celebrations.

Agricultural celebrations dedicated to the *Tośquoggo* are common in river valley communities.  The most important of these are **The First Melt** (*Vae Rhüge*) and **The Final Harvest** (*Ulfärh Yêrrhâugo*).  **The First Harvest** (*Vae Yêrrhâugo*) is also celebrated in many communities, not just along the river.

### The First Melt - *Vae Rhüge*

*Vae Rhüge* is a celebration that derives from an ancient tradition of welcoming the Spring Messengers.  It is traditional for each community, upon receiving word that the first melting of snow has begun, to send messengers to other communities downstream to warn of the coming floods, allowing them to prepare.  The message originates at the communities living in the Mountain Springs (*Jêiśħeimonj*) and is passed all the way down to the River Coast (*Xärrhättśonj*).  The messengers are termed the Spring Messengers (*Rhüźaindükke*), and are always warmly welcomed even if the respective communities have otherwise bad relations - the tradition plays a vital role in maintaining order in the river valley communities, and no community wants to miss out on receiving the messenger the next year.  This is one of the few celebrations that isn't tied to a specific deity, although it is often associated with *Qu'ħusko* (seasons), *Vaoñdvikke* (travels) and *Yinddźaoge* (day / non-winter).

*Vae Rhüge* is celebrated around the start of spring, the day after the arrival of the first of the Messengers, although the period before that is often used as preparation.  The festivities last for 5 days, though small feasts are often thrown to honour any Messenger who arrives after that time.  The festival is also used as an opportunity for intercommunity diplomacy and to build ties between communities.

### Harvest Festivals

**The First Harvest** (*Vae Yêrrhâugo*) is celebrated among many communities, not just the ones on the river valley.  It is dedicated to both of the *Tośquoggo* and their ancestral representatives, entreating them to grant the community a long and peaceful Autumn in order to have a successful harvest.

**The Final Harvest** (*Ulfärh Yêrrhâugo*) is again primarily celebrated by communities near the river valley, though also by nearby communities in the coastal lands and highlands.  It is dedicated to *Tośquoggo* to thank them for a successful harvest season, and *Ienjaoge* to get on his and his representatives' good sides to avoid their wrath over the Winter.

The two Harvest Festivals are celebrated with feasts and carousal.  The *Tośquoggo* are sometimes revered as God and Goddess of Revelry; other communities revere *Tfencikke* as a Goddess of the Soul / the True Self and believe that drinking to excess allows the Soul/True Self to take control.  

### Ancestor Worship

Each important ancestor is celebrated around once a year around the time of their death, but these celebrations tend to be personal and sombre.  They often involve burning of incense, preparation of a specific dish dear to the person and/or ritualistic consumption of psychoactive substances to commune with them.

Families traditionally maintain shrines to their ancestors, with larger and wealthier families maintaining a family temple as well.  In lower river lands, where each person has their own ancestors, this tradition has become somewhat obsolete and people use common temples to worship their own ancestors.  In upper river kingdoms/the Central Kingdom, all temples have been converted to worship the ruler's ancestral pantheon.  In towns and villages elsewhere, the traditional family shrines remain.

In addition to this, worship of one's ancestors includes acknowledging and praising them every so often.  This praising of ancestors made its way into everyday conversation by the late Bronze Era, with common phrases both praising them and serving some other purpose.  For example, the phrase *ulompëqoñ tśarix qamke qâ* 'your ancestors are wise' is commonly used as a greeting (later shortened to *tśar-lom-ke*); *ħouś X* is used as 'you're welcome', substituting X for the name of one's own ancestors, literally 'X (is) good-natured'.

## Social and Civic Culture

[back to chapter top](#6-culture)

### Urbanisation

- Villages develop into towns and cities in the lower river plains first, fuelled by fertile farmland and easy access to clay brick for construction
- Villages in the upper river valley are next, using the sturdier but much harder to work stone and abundant wood.  After conquering the lower plains, these cities expand rapidly to accomodate a new class of craftspeople, scholars and artists
- Villages away from the river valley mostly remain villages or towns.  Near the river valley they usually pay taxes/contributions in return for protection and certain rights, farther away they are usually independent townships

### Authority

- People swore allegiance to Tribes in the early Bronze era, but as populations grew and villages gained more power, each village tended to break away from the larger tribe and become self-governing.  Tribal allegiances remained strong in the Northlands and remote Highlands, where village development was slower.
- In many early villages, the leader was elected by village elders; in the Lower Kingdoms this was extended as a King was elected for life by a council made up of representatives of certain districts (these districts often had their origin in separate towns); the council members themselves being elected by elders from their own district.
- In the upper river region, the shift of Ancestral Pantheon to the leader meant that the role of leader would naturally pass within the same family, leading naturally to a Hereditary Monarchy in Upper Kingdoms.

### Administration

- Rudimentary records systems spreads from Lower Kingdoms using clay tablets.  Also appears frequently on pottery and bricks
- However, this recording system requires a long process (clay is imprinted, then fired) and only used for official records
- As the capital moves to the Upper River, the use of clay tablets is impractical (as clay must be imported from the Lower River).  Once Ironworking is discovered, relegating Copper to ceremonial use, Copper is used to mint tokens containing symbols to represent a similar system to the clay tablet recordings
- Accounting/Administration techniques are also learnt from Shechageghern traders, allowing businesses and commerce to flourish during the Central Kingdom

### Symbolism

- Royal Colour of the Seadragon Strait (*Śaśśüħênj*) and River Coast (*Xärrhättśonj*) is Purple (*Jêddźâugou*), derived from crushed seashells (*jêddźâu*)
- Royal Colour of the Lower River region (*Puruttśonj*) is Turquoise (*Toprhâeë*), derived from minerals containing copper (*tottśof*)
- Royal Colour of the Upper River region (*Xâeputtśonj*) is Crimson (*paccanjrhaoi*), derived from certain crushed insects (*pa'njanjh*)
