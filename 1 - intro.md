# Introduction to Uħħuonanjh

**Uħħuonanjh** /ˈuħˌħuo̯næɲ̊/ is the language spoken during the Bronze and Iron Ages by the **Uħħuononj** /ˈuħˌħuo̯nɔɲ/ people.  The Uħħuononj, one of three groups descended from the Vuhîñkam, descend from the people who chose to stay in the Vuhînkam homeland rather than migrate outwards.  The prevailing mythology among the Uħħuononj explains this as dedication to their ancestors resting in the ground below them, though this hasn't stopped the people from migrating outwards from the river valley.
